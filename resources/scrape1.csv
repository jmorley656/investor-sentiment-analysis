At the end of the day Berenburg do not I believe,  have any more info that you or I do, most particulary when it comes down to the valuation of the 5%, because if they did! their press releases might well  be undermining official GGP releases etc??

Today 15:48,mushroomkid,RE: Why would u short this,"More on JPM:(Reuters 29th September 2020) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, the U.S. authorities said on Tuesday.The landmark multi-agency settlement lifts a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and marks a signature victory for the governmentâs efforts to clamp down on illegal trading in the futures and precious metals market.JPMorgan will pay $436.4 million in fines, $311.7 million in restitution and more than $172 million in disgorgement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Tuesday, the biggest-ever settlement imposed by the derivatives regulator.Between 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement.This manipulative practice, which is designed to create the illusion of demand, or lack thereof, is known as âspoofing.âSome of the trades were made on JPMorganâs own account, while on occasions traders manipulated the market to facilitate trades by hedge fund clients, the CFTC said. The bank failed to identify, investigate, and stop the behavior, even after a new surveillance system flagged issues in 2014, the agency said.âThe conduct of the individuals referenced in todayâs resolutions is unacceptable and they are no longer with the firm,â said Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank.He added that the bank had invested âconsiderable resourcesâ in boosting its internal compliance policies, surveillance systems and training programs.In parallel settlements, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of Connecticut, staving off criminal prosecution on charges of wire fraud.It also agreed to pay $35 million to settle related charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the bankâs payment to the CFTC would offset that fine, it said.In an unusual concession, JPMorgan also admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the SEC and Justice Dept. settlements.âThis record-setting enforcement action demonstrates the CFTCâs commitment to being tough on those who intentionally break our rules, no matter who they are. Attempts to manipulate our markets wonât be tolerated,â said CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert.The CFTC and Justice Department have taken aim at spoofing in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect.

Rationale being that as time goes by things move from a higher risk profile to a lower risk profile - that move increases the inherent value. Obviously it could go the other way too, but I err towards the positive.I think getting 5% now can be seen two ways in terms of value. The positive - takes out risks regarding funding, the negative - 5% of the asset may be more valuable than the cash (which will be spent/get inflated away), depends how well it's utilised - ultimately that's what we have the management team for.Agree that the share price might re-rate as there will be new baseline value attributed to the asset - that will likely reflect a 'premium' to current share price.

Today 10:56,Dip666,RE: Notes from Proactive Results Interview - 31 Jan 2022,"* And what about construction activities, howâs all that going?-  Constructions going well, multi-faceted in terms of getting the infrastructure at surface and in parallel with that, doing the Feasibility Study (FS) but thereâs a lot of focus always on the decline- Got about 277m as of the date of this report in change into the length of that decline- Very positive, starting to see that accelerate, probably got about another 40-50m in this top area (softest ground and slowest part of the progress).  - As we get deeper there, the ground conditions get âharderâ (referring to the texture not the ability to dig into it) which actually accelerates progress because cuts can be bigger and less ground support required which allows you to accelerate, so done a lot of the hard worth there- Pleasing the way it is progressing, albeit a little bit slow through that earlier area, continued to do a lot of geo-tech drilling and think we have the pathway or route that will accelerate this from here. *Shaun, this option for Newcrest to buy an additional 5% of Havieron from Greatland, whatâs the timetable around that?- Newcrest started that process towards the very end of December 2021, potentially that can be resolved as early as February if we have commercial agreement between the two parties- That is Greatlandâs preference and think itâs always good with a JV partner to be able to come to agreement on these terms, so weâll will continue to talk to them around that- Alternatively, if that canât be achieved within the timeframe, it goes into this more independent arbitration process, thatâs a much longer process, so optimistic that we might be able to come to agreement with Newcrest in the short term- As far as Greatland is concerned, have got to prepare for both scenarios equally, equally a more drawn out process which brings in a number of independent valuations.* With 8 rigs operational at Havieron currently, whatâs the vision, the focus for Greatland for the project this year?- Itâs a big year for us, the focus continues to be that exploration you spoke about, particularly that 50,000m growth drilling program together with a lot of infill drilling and youâve seen some infill drilling again in this exploration update- That all positions us really well for a bigger and better FS in the back half of this year   - I do like the quote from Newcrest CEO Sandeep ââ¦â¦the numbers only get better from here.â - So, I think thatâs really positive and in parallel with that Greatland is speaking to a number of banks, have got some really positive interest from the Banking market, so would like to be in a position where weâre effectively full funded- We have the FS and then weâre going into 2023, which should see first production- So, the countdown clock is ticking a little bit to first production and thatâs a really exciting and potentially value creating process for our shareholders, so lots to do - but pleasingly so. *** The End **",No Opinion,13.65

If NCM agree with GGP around the 5% at a very fair had driven value, then great we have a spring board of finances and it sends a message to the market that NCM actually value Havieron very highly as they are willing to put their money where there mouth is. This should make the SP rerate significantly and hopefully attract the big boys/more iiâs.Scenario 2.Both parties donât come to an agreement on the 5% it goes to the independent expert evaluation. This process will likely take months, which while frustrating for all involved will ultimately lead to a HIGHER valuation, as all this extra time the drill bits will be turning, proving up more resource.

If NCM seek to lowball on the 5% value then they set Hav up for others to come in and bid for the remainder. If they give FMV that includes some futuristic estimates then with every passing assay realising more and more value at Hav then the price for purchasing the remainder goes up and up IMHO. So does it make commercial sense for NCM just to purchase the extra 5% now, or bite the bullet and bid for the whole of Hav?

Sun 21:38,petejh,RE: SAS,"Spade. The fatal flaw in your argument whereby GGP hold out for a valuation based on 20 million ounces, is that close to 3  years ago Greatland agreed to enter into a legal contract which contained an obligation to sell 5% of Havieron to Newcrest (should they want it) for fair market value *at a particular point in time* long long long before a 20m ounce figure is even a glint in the chief resource geologist's eye. Greatland knew when they signed this JV that this moment would come long before the full resource could be known - this is the black and white reality of the cost of doing business as a junior when you can't afford to develop the mine yourself. The. valuation. process. doesn't. work. the. way. you. want. it .to.   If you actually believe what you're saying then you're a massively clueless. You're chirping with the birds, seriously.

Sun 19:41,petejh,RE: SAS,"Zoros, I agree with your logic of there being a maximum number of ounces in ground that could be used by an independent valuator (from my limited understanding of recently reading Valmin). Anything above the ounces contained within MRE2 will likely fall under the category of a forward-looking statement and would need to have a very solid foundation in fact to class as a reasonable  assumption. 10m ozs (gold equiv for sake of simplicity) appears a reasonable figure to cut off at, without getting seriously into the realms of high uncertainty.That leads to what value do GGP/NCM respectively put on 5% of Hav's 10m ozs? And the related - what value would an independent valuator put on 10m ozs of gold equiv in the specific context of Hav?I initially thought a value of around $250m for the 5%, by assuming $500 per ounce in-ground was reasonable. It still might be that.. but I've since halved my estimate to $250 per oz in-ground for a 5% valuation guestimate of $125m. Add on some figure for 'other exploration targets' within the Hav license, and 'perhaps' a small resource growth royalty. For a total value in the region of $150-$200m or Â£110-Â£150m. i.e. between GGP's current market cap/sp and high teens sp. This keeps my feet on the ground and my expectations not in danger of hugely serious disappointment, with still a chance of some upside.  SAS, $500m! For 5% of 10m ozs gold equiv? This implies Newcrest paying $1,000 per in-ground oz - some of which ozs won't even be included in the upgraded resource estimate and thus not even in an 'inferred' category. Are you out of your mind? That is never, ever, going to happen in ten million years. It's possible, in the same way an asteroid striking you tomorrow is possible. To call a spade a spade you're talking absolute ******.  https://seekingalpha.com/article/4471765-pretium-acquired-by-newcrest-a-great-deal-for-pretiumThe above article outlines the Pretivm deal on a per oz in ground basis plus a few other recent acquisitions by majors.  See if you can find a deal where a Major paid more than $750 per ounce in-ground, especially for ounces that aren't even in the inferred category yet :))))) Or find a deal where a major paid more than $350 per ounce for indicated ounces, or more than $150 for inferred ounces. Ask yourself what category of ounces are being valued at Hav? Answer - a small number are reserve ounces (might get $750 per oz or even more), some are indicated (might get $350 per oz or even more), some inferred (might get $150 per oz or even more). Then look at how getting from MRE2 to 10m ozs requires assuming a couple of million ounces as yet uncategorised in any resource estimate. How high a $per oz for these? Less than for inferred obviously.They'll use 2 methods to estimate value: 'market-based' - a comparison of other transactions. Income-based - a DCF of future income. That's the logic. $500m!

I'm hoping they are doing this anyway  - just common sense when negotiating anything like this from my own experience.2/ Failing the above, see how initial negotiations play out, are there huge variances or not in early stages that seem fairly unlikely to close?- If we're looking at a scanrio where we're an ocean apart, then I'd be thinking about the certainty of this going more towards a 3rd party assessment and focus more on establishing a value that would have a higher probability of being determined as closest to FMV, more so than closing a deal with NCM. Having a consultant from SRK in our Technical Committee should be useful in that regard and in fact they should be doing this from the outset I assume.3/ If the values are say within 15-20% , continue with trying to negotiate closer and even suggest 'tweaks' to the agreed process to help close a deal and as TT says - you could perhaps look to average with a wider range than 10%.

Both NCM and Shaun have reiterated repeatedly that Newcrest have 1200 staff with highly valuable experience at Telfer that they absolutely want to retain and they will do everything to avoid a gap between Telferâs rapidly diminishing output and Havieronâs production commencement to retain them. The issue is that if NCM had to let them go due to a gap between Havieron and the planned extension work at Telfer not being enough to retain many of the staff , then the really skilled and most effective staff will no doubt  get recruited sharpish by other companies in what we know is a massively under resourced sector desperate for personnel, services and equipment both globally and particularly in Oz.I think the decline in SP and uncertainty around the 5% option is really playing on many peoples fears now, I bet we wouldn't have half these conversations if the SP was still up in the 20's :-)",No Opinion,13.09

If you use GBR as one example - estimated a minimum of 10m ozs from surface at high grades, literally next to a paved  highway, within easy trucking distance of nearby processing mills, but no resource estimate or PFS or any development, and at least 5-6 years to production so still very early stage  - then you don't get a particularly high price per oz. of $140 if taken at purchase price.If you use Spectrum Metals - extremely high average grade (14g/t), low ounces, long trucking distance to existing Ramelius mill, developed open pit -  you get a very high $ per oz of in the 700s. There are various other examples of low $ per oz but none are directly comparable to Hav. My finger in air, anything over $350 per ounce would be a great result, anything under $175 per oz would be a truly terrible result.Using DCF @4.5% discount rate, 30% of a 20m oz gold equiv block cave over 40 years production gives a current NPV equates to around 25p today, using conservative but not pessimistic assumptions.

They'll be using two methods of valuation - peer's market transactions and future estimated cash flow (using DCF) as their method.

An independent valuation can't reasonably use 20m ozs, or likely anything over 10m ozs as that would be a step way too far  in resource growth at this point in time for any reasonable independent valuation expert to put their name to - even the most enthusiastic and pro-GGP geologist wouldn't pin their professional name on 20m ozs just yet!

But perhaps this enhanced concentration of Au (If I am right in this perception) is due to metal migration under the influence of the heat regime adjacent to the dyke.Lateral migration is unlikely imho unless absorption  of cement breccia with ejection of metal by the dyke can be demonstrated.So perhaps migration has been vertical from depth along the boundary/ interface dyke to cement breccia.Will we find partial depletion lower down ?Info so far says not as grade and bulk increases with depth ..... so far. So no negative effect evident so far.The dyke is a common factor cutting two separate (apparently discreet) ore bodies, ie E Breccia and Ovoid.Is the dyke a possitive modifying event ?Are the grades in E Breccia really higher than the Ovoid ?Interesting. !!!! â",Strong Buy,13.09

In sandstone which the decline will be reaching shortly it can do about 8m per day on 2 shifts. Well they are working on 3 shifts.I reckon at 350m the roadheader should be coming in.The photos of the Decline face on that collage look good enough for the roadheader but I donât know the stability of the roof so we must be getting close.Peoples enthusiasm for a fast pace was over done, I did try and warn people that the ground at the start would be poor.I would have preferred a tunnelling machine but the miners donât use them in Australia due to the cost, 600m would have taken a month.But hey ho we have what we have maybe 60 days till the roadheader then 180 days with a roadheader should be close to the ore by August/September which according to that timeline is about 3 months behind. Iâm sure the contractors will finish on time in October as other machines will be brought in to do all the ancillary tunnels when possible.In the 277m length thereâs possibly 2 side tunnels already excavated which would have slowed things up, these are needed for turning machines around otherwise a lot reversing in and out with machines.",Strong Buy,13.09

Sat 10:32,zoros,RE: Its time we talked about the decline.,"Lenz - concur.Production will ramp up inexorably, from the piddling 2Mt/yr up to 6 - 11Mt/yr when both mines are running in tandem. To achieve this, the access tunnels need to increase hence a 2nd decline and also a conveyor belt system needs to be built between Hav and Telfer complementing the highway currently being considered.Telfer max capacity (as it stands) is 2 x trains each of an output of 11Mt/yr.I guess there could be a situation where NCM touts for business for Telfer from other neighbouring miners like Artemis et al.

The price should go right up n up now?That will happen. But only with strong buying pressure. That will then force the MMs to move it up to get the sellers they need etc.Unfortunately GGP had that in 2020. Lost it in 2021, and hasn't got it back. What 7.5 Million sold, 10 million bought after the results yesterday (from LSE, which I know is an approximation, but....). That's no pressure to move it up at all to where all holders would like.GGP has some good assets. But isn't flavour of the month anymore. Combined with the poor market sentiment, and it is what it is for now.I still hold 1.65 million here at 3.6p, and simply await the firming up of the assets and further on production or take out. I held 7.7 million at peak mid 2020. But moved funds on for family and other options during the bull run. That was more necessities, and luck than great planning per say. But I still think what I have left will come good in a year or two. But for now it's one to bottom draw if a LTH. Or if you are new this could be a decent entry IMO sure. Though there are a lot of competitive options out there. That's also a factor in the lack now of buyers of course.But moaning about crooked MM or markets seems to me to miss the point, that this needs buys, and buys in big volumes to change the sentiment for now.Just my take.

Sat 05:58,Bamps21,Drill 104,"This drill reported the best drill results outside of the main ovoid.Whatâs been puzzling me is the identification number 104, the latest drills are in the 150s.Why has it taken so long to come out, itâs a long drill but itâs not that long.Geologists have been talking about nickel being found deep but where?104 has found a new crescent style grades in the Eastern breccia, itâs been described as a new intrusion in a NW-SE trend.Itâs taken a long time to come to light and I donât think we know the full story of it yet only gold and copper have been reported.My initial thoughts hearing about nickel being down deep went to the end of drill 90W1, one of our deepest, itâs about 200m to the SE of 104 intercepts but deeper.This new high grade zone is a separate intrusion but the cemented breccia looks as though they are coming from here feeding up into the main ore body changing the crackle into cemented.A very complex ore system.The miner I talk to thinks the heat generated when the Dyke was formed would have concentrated more minerals around the Dyke. We are seeing this concentration with nearly every drill and now 104 has found more evidence of this.Iâm expecting more evidence of this when exploration drills test further north, I was hoping Havieron north would have it but I believe they were too far west and not quite deep enough.The magnetic surveys show an anomaly down there and they havenât found it yet. The alteration in that drill will give them vectoring clues in which direction to drill next. Downhole survey instruments will also give better clues.At the moment the Dyke within the ore body is sloping downwards to the East and is not straight itâs all over the place, so where theyâve shown it on the plans is at the top of the ore, theyâve not drawn it lower down so at Havieron north it could be anywhere down below.",Strong Buy,13.09

Occurring between 2018 and 2020, employees used WhatsApp, text messages, and personal email accounts to communicate about sensitive business matters. JPMorgan has acknowledged that these failures in record-keeping were firm-wide and such practices were not hidden within the firm.Gary Gensler, SEC chair, stated: ""As technology changes, it's even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight.âThe SEC stated when responding to subpoenas, JPMorgan frequently did not search for relevant records contained on the personal devices of employees.âJPMorganâs failures hindered several commission investigations and required the staff to take additional steps that should not have been necessary,â Sanjay Wadhwa, the SECâs deputy director of enforcement. âThis settlement reflects the seriousness of these violations. Firms must share the mission of investor protection rather than inhibit it.âThis is understood to be the largest SEC fine yet for record-keeping violations.The bank received a further $75 million fine from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Friday for using unapproved communications.In a statement the CFTC said: ""Since at least July 2015, JPMorgan employees, including those at senior levels, communicated both internally and externally on unapproved channels, including via personal text messages and WhatsApp messages.â""None of these written communications were maintained and preserved by JPMorgan, and they were not able to be furnished promptly to a CFTC representative when requested,"" the statement continued.NB: Boycott T212 who lend out your shares to shorters.",No Opinion,14.1

But I have read the RNS and I'm very pleased with the numbers on show in particular the Eastern Breccia with hole HAD104. The Eastern Breccia is showing real signs of promise with very good intercepts and showing mineralization on the eastern side of the dolerite dyke for the first time I believe. More intercepts in the South East crescent deeps target too just keeps reinforcing the mineralization outside the MRE shell and it is only a matter of time before we will see an updated figure on that. The Havieron North hole hit ""Havieron style"" alteration. So not the clean hit we were all hoping for but I'm quietly optimistic that Havieron North may be the alteration footprint around the Zipa target. We have two holes awaiting assay there so we will wait and see. Next up we should have some closure on the MRE 2.0 and the 5% valuation to come. So i'll be staying nice and patient awaiting those. Main take home for me is that the Eastern Breccia is seemingly becoming a separate trend of mineralization.

""The results at the Eastern Breccia, several hundred meters away from the South East Crescent zone where most of the drilling activity has occurred to date, confirm the potential for a new zone of high grade mineralisation.

""In addition, we consistently observe high grade results and intersections of significant mineralisation at the South East Crescent zone which supports the upgrade of the Inferred Mineral Resource.""With drill rigs all focused on growth targets and decline construction activities operating on a 24hr schedule there is tremendous progress in the development of this world class project and excitement in understanding the size and scale of Havieron.""",No Opinion,13.7

Drillingis now focussed on defining the extents of this higher-grade mineralisation which remains open in alldirections.- At the South East Crescent Zone the infill drilling completed validates both geological and grade continuity.- Drill testing of new geophysical targets 2km outside of the Havieron system has commenced.More exceptional results...Deeper, wider, longer and still open in all directions and at depth!

All these Dicks who come on spreading FUD are only here because they want what we already have. They know how massive this is becoming and because there is no chance of shares being available through new placings, they are deliberately trying to get weak holders to sell at ever decreasing levels. The way I see it is that the free float of shares is getting smaller by the day. You can tell this just by the amount of shares traded each day. Traders are obviously still here, but most holders are just sitting as Paddy says with bums on hands. In some way, I just wish GGP would do a 10/1 consolidation, as that would make it even worse for getting hold of shares. The MMâs have driven this price down. Nothing to do with what our asset is actually worth, but because of such a small amount of shares being traded. It doesnât matter to them if we are priced at 13p or 130p, they will trade at a price where they can make money. At some point this will turn around, and when it does I wonât be at all surprised to see it rise again to new ATHâs far quicker than it fell. Now whoâs going to blink first ?Somehow I donât see it being the holders. If the MMâs want to return to days of 50,60,100 million shares traded in a day, they will have to raise the price just to tempt some to sell and that alone will see daily % gains and tempt new investors onboard just like during 2020.

GGP have already said they will be absolutely taking into account all knowledge to date re the wider Hav system in their position, which is hopefully MRE2 plus some further anticipated growth. For me they will settle on something which reflects an element of reasonable upside based on current knowledge but quite rightly gives NCM v decent scope for gaining its proper advantage from further resource growth, as they will be paying out cash to GGP now.

But they have done enough drilling now to come up with a few million more ounces than that contained in the MRE - which was only based on drilling to October 2020.

You just wouldn't, or at least a CEO with ambitions wouldn't.And yes I know all about you can't get a 100% of what the gold in the ground is worth, but I think paying 50% for it should be looked upon as a great deal for NCM. It's like saying you buy one ounce and you get one ounce for free.I'm banking on reserves being at least 20M ounces in time, and @ $1000 per ounce profit that is an overall pre tax profit of around $20 Billion. with POG staying around $1800.So in my eyes and my opinion, 30% of that would be a nice $6 Billion to GGP. So I would be saying, look Sandeep, both you and I know what's down there, if you want a further 5% then I will give you a 50% discount for it, so just sign the cheque for $500 Million and be done with it. You will also make $500 Million over time, otherwise I'll keep the 5% and cash in with a $Billion dollars myself over time.

You can never prove anything until it's in your hand.Like anything in life, you pays your money and you take your chances. Now that can work both ways, NCM & GGP could of already had conversations and assume there is 20M oz's eqivalent in the ground, and decide that that is the figure both parties are happy to do the calculations on.Now If it ends up where there are only 15M oz's, GGP win.If it ends up there are 40M oz then NCM win.  I have seen many opinions on this subject touted on this board since the news hit and this is my opinion.Yes I seem to be at the higher end of valuations opinionated, but why not, like I said, I have not seen anywhere were it states that is only based on what is known up to now.

Thu 13:23,Texlax30,RE: Pivot point,"My preferred scenario for the 5% deal is a method that would be (a) be fair to all parties, and (b) not have to âguessâ at any of the unknowns.  This method would include a per oz premium, and only take into account indicated / reserve ounces to date.Letâs assume MRE2 contains 2.5m indicated ounces, ultimately to be included as reserves in the updated PFS. Thus the negotiation would be based on 125,000 ounces (5%).Now we must find a fair premium for these ounces, and of course Iâm going straight to the Pretium deal as representative of recent  fair market value. Our ore body is more economic as we have copper (Brucejack AISC over $900), though our ounces have a few years before they come out of the ground.  The key, though, is that to date we have contributed capex for this 5%, which must be accounted for to our benefit (again, strictly for the inferred ounces in MRE2).  Weâre effectively selling our HGZ ounces in which weâve already contributed to the mine build, thus I want a premium of USD 775/oz.Thatâs just under $100m to GGP now, knock off the loan balance and we have a nice pot of operating costs for the next couple of years to ramp up exploration, all while HAV goes into production. Also, a bank balance to assist with debt financing for HAV.For Newcrest, this gets them their 5% with limited capital up front, whilst being able to wax lyrical about the resource growth requiring this approach.Going forward and as the 5% grows, we get a cash payment every resource update, though agree a hefty discount as a sweetener for NCM, say $350/oz per indicated.  Depending upon the rate of proving up the tenement, this could be an additional $20m - $40m a year to GGP, over the next ten years plus (who really knows how big this thing is).This protects the time value of NCM capital and limits up front cash, whilst satisfying our short to mid term cash needs.  It ensures an additional revenue stream for us, and keeps the JV relationship health.  It also keep NCM honest - this is the type of âfair market valueâ theyâve shown in the Pretium deal.Most importantly, it protects the markets perceived value of Havieron for both companies.

Thu 08:51,StarBright,RE: Pivot point,"A long thread with some thoughtful contributions. @JJNortonâs original pivot point idea has merit in my view as it contemplates market perception of time, costs of extraction and risk etc. Responses were perhaps shaped more by the Â£100m chosen to simplify illustration than by the underlying idea.I expect the JV partners to reach agreement on the 5% without (publicly at least!) rocking the boat that is sailing smoothly. The price* will be lower than some posters are hoping for - partly because of the âthree-factors-that-are-not-permitted-to-be-mentioned-hereâ, and partly because future development potential will have to be âriskedâ one way or another. In simple terms, Fair Market Value =/= Future Market Value. It may - as I have proposed previously, and as discussed by @sydjames and @Matty56 above - be better to consider the 5% as the last instalment of the farm-in rather than as an advance on the final 25%. I am optimistic that the deal for the 5% will be a material positive for GGPâs funding position, but I am sceptical as to whether it will prove to be the near-term positive inflection point in sp that some are looking for. We may see some volatility - in price and on this board - as a result. MRE upgrades will be more important in the long run, so constitute the major area of interest in forthcoming news for investors.The âGated Feasibility Study to Executionâ in q4 looks to me like the point at which the real excitement will start, because it is then that the project might be dressed to the nines for capital raising purposes. If so we will find out how wholesale capital providers (both debt & equity) are prepared to value the project, and I am sure that NCM will throw all it has behind this. I think their interests are best served by maximising value perception then, rather than now. At the end of the day the only sure way for GGP to realise the âfuture market valueâ of the 25% will be to hold its interest for the long term, and it has every opportunity to do this. If (as I suspect) NCM really really want 100% then GGP will have an opportunity to exit at a premium. Q4 will present some big decisions for SD and his team, and weâll get a better indication then of how big the prize is.*I will be surprised to see anything other than one straightforward price as the underlying concept of FMV is at odds with the idea of agreeing a formula to adjust for future developments.",No Opinion,13.3

You just wouldn't, or at least a CEO with ambitions wouldn't.And yes I know all about you can't get a 100% of what the gold in the ground is worth, but I think paying 50%  for it should be looked upon as a great deal for NCM. It's like saying you buy one ounce and you get one ounce for free.I'm banking on reserves being at least 20M ounces in time, and @ $1000 per ounce profit that is an overall pre tax profit of around $20 Billion. with POG staying around $1800.So in my eyes and my opinion, 30% of that would be a nice $6 Billion to GGP. So I would be saying, look Sandeep, both you and I know what's down there, if you want a further 5% then I will give you a 50% discount for it, so just sign the cheque for $500 Million and be done with it. You will also make $500 Million over time, otherwise I'll keep the 5% and cash in with a $Billion dollars myself over time.

This 5% will put a minimum on our value if Newcrest decide to buy Hav out!(not that I think or want it to happen, I want to go producing).If we get the Cannacord estimate of $280m for the 5%, then weâre looking at a minimum value for the 25% at $1.4bn, which would also be the minimum buyout amount for Newcrest if they did want the extra 25%.Bear in mind the 5% is using in-ground value and ounces expected up to now. With more drilling, comes more ounces and with more ounces at a premium to in-ground value (could be at least double as others have alluded to), you could realistically say that Newcrest would need to pay a minimum of $3-4bn for a buyout. With the extra ounces clearly visible and the low aisc of the starter mine and going lower with block cave, it could feasibly be a lot more than $3/4bn. Would love $350m Ben!!

Therefore if our current Mcap is Â£562m dividing Â£4.73bn by Â£562m = 11.3879. If you multiply our current SP (13.9p) x 11.3879 = Â£1.58 that our SP should rise to as FMV for the whole of Havieron.

Wed 15:15,Dip666,RE: Newcrest Valuation of Hav,"We have to also keep in mind that that the 5% FM valuation we will probably see is a result of two teams negotiating, not the same as an actual public valuation report conducted using guidance under the Valmin Code where some of us can happily pore over a massive document reviewing every little detail. If the above were the case, we would see a range of values and then a case for selecting a particular value and methodology from the various ranges and secondary methods used to justify final assumptions.Example:1/ Valuations within a 10% range are agreed so average taken and Â£210m is the price tag for NCM to mull over for 30 days because :- GGP happy at Â£220m- NCM happy at Â£200mBoth happy.2/ Say we go to arbitration and Â£200m gets determined as the price tag for NCM to mull over for 30 days because :- GGP submitted Â£425m for their valuation- NCM submitted Â£200m for their valuation- 3rd party calculated Â£300m FMV so they go with NCM's value as per FMV process as determined as being closer to FMVNCM happier.3/ Say we go to arbitration and Â£350m gets determined as the price tag for NCM to mull over for 30 days because:- GGP submitted Â£350m for their valuation  - NCM submitted Â£200m for their valuation- 3rd party calculated Â£300m FMV so they go with GGP's value as per FMV process as determined being closer to FMVGGP happier.We'll only be told the final price tag from my understanding, perhaps not even if they had to use an average if no 3rd party required? If so, then making assumptions it is an accurate and true valuation is perhaps not that accurate as taking the FMV price tag and calculating our 30% of Havieron is thrown off by even a Â£10m difference for each 5% :-)Looking at scenario's 1 and 2, to me it really really makes sense for NCM/GGP to be collaborative as some really random outcomes could happen via 3rd party based on whatever valuation each party submits, even with the same FMV value and also why I think each need to keep this in mind and be sensible!",No Opinion,13.5

Wed 14:05,GGPThruandtru,5% Reposting (Cannacord $280m),"So now that theyâve fixed the site and we can see old posts, I thought Iâd repost this from when the note came out. Turns out it wasnât $228m but $280m. Go figure (hands out emoji) Reposting coz I like it and think itâs pretty close to what we might get if the brokers valued it. (Iâd hazard a guess any third party, if needed, will probably use same workings). Think using the broker note as a basis is better than any wild guesses. Cannacord note -""FMV assessment are likely to range from $25m, based on 5% of the South-East Crescent NPV estimate in the initial PFS to our estimate of $280m based on our estimate of gold ounces likely to be in the ground""So, it's not a range as such. The $25m is for the PFS and the $280m is for the total ounces Cannacord are expecting to be proven up currently. Two different values, as opposed to a range. Makes me think they don't know what will be used. Clarification would be good. But back to the $280m valuation. Brokers past notes have used between 10-12moz total current predictions. Using these we can calculate Cannacord's price for each ""in-ground"" ounce of gold.10moz @5% = 500koz$280m divided by 500koz = $560 per ounce ""in-ground"" value12moz @5% = 600koz$280m divided by 600koz = $466.66 per ounce ""in ground"" valueSounds to me like we will be getting closer to the $280 estimation as I would expect the deal to include all estimated current ounces at least! Maybe the final decision will be timed to coincide with the MRE2 where they are able to put a line in the sand in terms of ounces and potential ounces.Happy with the new news, hoping like crazy that future ounces are included somehow, but the above ""in-ground"" value of each ounce is very good in my eyes from Cannacord.T&T",No Opinion,13.5

The major difference is in the fact that Newcrest have the upper hand with the 5% valuation as they have the option to either take it up or not,  depending on the valuation that is either jointly assessed or by the independent valuers.The balance of  HAV alone or the company as a whole is a different scenario as there we have the upper hand.

AUD 1,942 (US $1,387)Telfer is a large scale, low grade mine and its profitability and cash flow are sensitive to the realised Australian dollar gold price. Hedging instruments in the form of Australian dollar gold forward contracts were put in place in 2016 to 2018 to secure margins on a portion of future planned production to June 2023, to support investment in cutbacks and mine development.The current period included 216,639 ounces of Telfer gold sales hedged at an average price of A$1,864 per ounce, representing a net revenue loss of $99 million for the current period. At 30 June 2021, based on gold forward curves, the unrealised mark-to-market loss of the remaining hedges was $110 million.Approximately 90% of Newcrestâs gold sales in the period were unhedged and therefore benefitted from the strong gold prices in the period.Newcrestâs decision in the prior period to cease its program of hedging the impacts of copper and gold price movements during the quotational period resulted in a net fair value gain in other income in the current period of $124 million, driven by the increase in gold and copper prices in the current period.",No Opinion,13.5

We also know we have copper and a more economic / profitable mine based on current info.  Brucejack, whilst having amazing though sporadic grades, has had its issues.  Put it this way, itâs no HAV.If theyâre willing to drop that kind of capital in rural Canada for 100% ownership, I just donât see them stopping at 5% with us when they already own 70% of a mine sat in their back yard.  Unless they have categorically  chosen to keep GGP alongside for some strategic purpose, I just canât find any reason to think they wonât try - it makes too much sense for them.It makes you wonder what language is in the JV agreement - if I was GGP and wanted to see the asset into production over the next 30 years, Iâd be looking to sell 1-2% royalty stream, (a) for a sizeable cash injection, and (b) a small dilution of our interest to a separate party might deter any takeover.

JV partner â Newcrest Mining, just announced a maiden resource of 4.2 million ounces of gold equivalent. The deposit is wide open so as Newcrest continues to drill it while they soon start driving an underground decline, I am certain the deposit will get a lot bigger. Newcrest should take them over but if Newcrest feels the takeover would be to expensive, the worst case scenario is that Newcrest starts mining this very profitable deposit and doesnât takeover GGP, then Newcrest will have to share 25% of the profit from the mining operation meaning GGP turns into a very profitable miner and would be re-rated accordingly.Hope this helps",No Opinion,13.0

25 Jan '22,spoon_key,RE: 5% valuation,"I just do not understand this 5% situation on here, some think if not force it onto us as a more or less fact that there could be 10's of millions of oz so if NCM offer say Â£175m for the 5% that = about 1 Â£billion mc for 30% (25%+the money for the 5%) Is this not a low ball offer? Would they then think GGP have done a bad deal, does the RNS or was it SD not basically say that that 5% figure will be derived from whats actually known and also the future potential?If this was the actual figure then how many oz = that Â£175m? If you use ProfQ's numbers then its about 6m oz which is far below what some think on here Hav could hold so then you have to ask whos more incorrect, the ones who assume far more gold, ProfQ's numbers or both? If its say 12m oz then thats about Â£300m for the 5% but again the 12m oz is still considered low in some peoples eyes? So after all that (it makes sense in my head what I typed) if GGP accepted Â£175m or Â£300m for the 5% would some on here not think GGP got a bad deal due to how much gold they think is there? One main respected poster for instance has mentioned 20m oz if this is true so if GGP accepted Â£300m for the 5% this is surely a low ball offer so then you have to ask whos wrong? Obviously its the poster on here as GGP know and understand it far more than anyone on here.Part reason I still dont own is because there is just so much contradictory info on here it makes it hard to know what to believe or who to listen to most, I try so hard to understand all the figures from the RNS's but it doesn't make it any easier. Will I buy in before the 5% is known? I'm not sure, if theres one thing I'm trying to do is not to jump in just to try to make a quick quid, dont buy if you are not sure is what has stopped me from getting in back when this was high teens, its still preventing me from buying now not because I think the sp could go lower (I have zero idea) but because I just dont understand the numbers enough!

25 Jan '22,ProfQuatermass,RE: Newcrest Valuation of Hav,"Here's a repeat of my guess:I have had a go at using the Newcrest / Pretium deal to try to value Havieron. Obviously I am no mathematician. Feel free to contradict me. Newcrest Pretium acquisition. 09.11.2021 Newcrest are spending $2.80bn US for 95%, so the 100 is valued about $2.95bn US. Brucejack has an AISC $743 and is forecast to produce 311k oz pa over 13 years, which is a total of 4,043,000oz Au. The deal values each oz Au @ $730. Havieron PFS suggests the AISC will be $643 and the area in the PFS will produce 160k oz pa over 9 years, which gives a total of 1,440,000oz Au. If we use the $730 oz Au figure on Hav that values Hav at $0.25 or Â£0.18, or Â£0.054 for GGP's share. It will actually be more than this, though, because of Havieron's lower AISC. However, we know that we have 4.2m oz Au eq in the MRE. Applying the $730 oz Au figure to that values Hav at Â£0.55, or Â£0.165 for GGP's share. Double the MRE, which doesn't seem unreasonable, and you get Â£0.33. That is Â£0.039 per m oz Au eq. Regis / Tropicana came out about Â£0.044 per m oz Au. Multiply the average (Â£0.042) by 4.2m oz Au and we get Â£0.176. 10m oz Au eq would mean Â£0.42 and so-on. You can do the maths. Obviously the Brucejack mine is up and running while Havieron isn't yet, but there is obviously a lot of room for our SP to climb. It may take a while, but it will definitely happen. You only need to look at the satellite to see that. Using the Â£0.042 per m oz Au eq figure to value the 5% Newcrest can acquire (0.042 mulitplied by oz Au, divided by 6 to get 5% instead of 30%, multiplied by number of shares (4,206,000,000)). 4.2 m oz Au: Â£123,656,400.006.3 m oz Au: Â£185,484,600.007.4 m oz Au: Â£217,870,800.0010.0 m oz Au: Â£294,420,000.0015.0 m oz Au: Â£441,630,000.0020.0m oz Au: Â£588,840,000.00 Berenberg 5% value at $220,000,000 / Â£165,000,000. Implies 5.5 m oz Au. (Company value at 23.01.2022: Â£0.142 per share / Â£597,252,000.00 market cap.) If we use these figure to value the 25% remaining, that gives these figures per fully diluted share: 4.2 m oz Au: Â£0.156.3 m oz Au: Â£0.227.4 m oz Au: Â£0.2610.0 m oz Au: Â£0.3515.0m oz Au: Â£0.5320.0m oz Au: Â£0.70 Interesting times: looks to me as though at the current price we're sitting on the launchpad.Q",No Opinion,13.0

Current plans is 2 for 3 million tons to come from current approach until block caving comes on stream. Will block caving deliver 11 million tons, i have no idea.4.

Conflict is always a good way to hide real economic problems. A week ago my post regarding a 40% to 90% correction in equities was removed. Well it has started and will take down GGP with it. This take down in PMs stock will not last long and JPM know this. The criminals at JPM will short this until there is a rush into PMs and related stock. I fully expect JPM to go long at that stage so the rise will be spectacular. JPM going long GGP is reliant on them not building a position for some other entity to put in a low ball offer. The traders  buying  the dip in the general markets will be trapped. PMs will be the go to asset and gold and silver will continue to accelerate to the upside.

Despite media coverage, my sense is that this is about the Fed and rates expectations more than it is about Russia. Whilst we are enjoying a broad-based sell-off here in the UK & Europe, it is becoming more nuanced in the US with material differences between sectors showing clearly. In many ways the US indices are hiding the real underlying story; many US tech names are now trading 30-40% down from ATH's seen in late 2021. There is a lot of rotation going on beneath the surface. For fund managers this is an interesting time as when the water goes out we get to find out who has been swimming naked. Expect active fund returns in 2022 to be ""unevenly distributed"" - some of the SPACs (perhaps particularly ARKK) are getting properly beaten. The US still sets the tone/context against which markets operate, and sector differentiation/rotation there often indicates the last stages of a correction.

24 Jan '22,thedoors,"Belief, strength, more belief, and more strength","Hi all, itâs been a while but just wanted to share my thoughts on the weeks and months ahead FWIW. We seem to be in the grip of a general market gloom and some macroeconomic stuff that remains volatile. We have ongoing analysis about the NCM/ FMV question with more questions than answers and a SP that is disappointing. There is a sense that whatever good news GGP releases it will not fully be reflected in an uplift in SP, and then we have JPM working a short (admin- not my words, theirs). There is a period of months during which serious ly good progress will be announced by GGP and NCM. My take is that we will remain suppressed but I hope Iâm wrong about that. My plans to pack up work depend on the opposite being true, but I am managing my expectations again that we are not in normal times and that investing is not linear despite regular positive news from GGP.However, we are a month in already to this year when so much progress is expected. The SP may remain sluggish even with good news, but donât despair. And I could be wrong. Whatever some might say on this board about the projects incl Hav your decisions have to be based on the quiet conversation you have with yourself when you make time to think it through, or when you talk it through with your better half or pals.Itâs not yet time to release the special supply of expensive booze and plan the cruise. Itâs time to keep a level head, take the knocks, and ride the punches. All the great achievements are hard earned and there is no âeasyâ money any more. We are all in the school of hard knocks at the moment but weâre coming through the weirdest of times. GGP will do very well and with that we will have some good times financially. Itâs new to me just like it is to you probably and this uncertainty could do your head in if you listen to the casters of doubt.

Capex and route to free cash flow:Excerpts From PFS Release InvestorMeet Presentation - Oct 2021:( Download full notes of Presentation and Q&A here: https://gofile.io/d/WAiIZV )*Slide - Low CAPEX, Low Risk -  The low capex nature of this and low risk is exceptional so overall we've got this 123 million USD funding, we have 50 of that already through the Newcrest facility so that leaves us with 73 million USD which is a very modest value particularly when you take into account that there's a contingency in this of 64 million USD - I talked about the confidence that we have in delivering the outputs of this study and again I want to recognise the value that Newcrest delivers in that partnership but we have a lot of confidence of delivering that and with those contingencies in there as well it gives us a lot of confidence there and importantly again, we have this 12 months of runway with the funding facility from Newcrest and then we can continue to pursue that over time and think about how to draw down the rest of those funds through a combination particularly of debt that we're currently looking at.  *Q&A - I know you did touch on funding but we did receive a number of pre-submitted questions relating to funding, will Greatland need to borrow significant amounts to fund the development of Havieron and will that be possible to obtain?Well look, I said before it's a good question, look I think the way I look at funding is in three parts you know. Firstly we have this existing facility in place, weâve drawn about 20, we have 30 million dollars of runway ahead of us on that which is expected to take us to delivery of the feasibility study in the December quarter, so we've got 12 months of runway ahead of us before we expect to have to contribute to the development of Havieron - so that's a lovely you know time frame to have it ahead of us.We're already engaging with banks so I think the question was you know will we have to borrow a lot of money? Well it's always nice to be offered a lot of money from the bank, we won't want to you know, we want to right-size our debt but I think for banks to be able to invest in you know a low risk jurisdiction, high quality mine, low risk partners (he says high in presentation but think it was a mistake) being developed with a brownfield development is exactly where banks want to have exposure too, so we have a lot of engagement.We've received term sheets already, uh we're going to be pursuing that and what does that do, it reduces the equity requirement if any to move forward  - so I think it's a luxurious position for us to be in and it all talks to this capex profile is just tailor-made for a mid-cap  - yeah it really is set out before us magnificently.2022 Update: We could potentially have a favourable 5% FMV valuation and decision to exercise it by NCM cover some/all of our costs for the 'Starter Mine'.",No Opinion,13.55

The original JV was for $65m MINIMUM spend to get to a certain point of the development (which if I remember correctly was the PFS)! Any other costs until that PFS above the $65 million is Newcrest expenditure! They will NOT be asking us for our cut of all the extra spend above that $65m. We were being carried till the PFS. That was supposed to take a few years to get to the PFS, but due to the size of the find and Telfer running out, everything has been speeded up. Hence the new JV terms and the $50m loan which was to help get us the DFS stage and start the decline.

And, simply not useful, nor accurate comparison.  Iâd go further, it looks like a statement purely designed to mislead investors Not sure why you might want to do that?  But, I could hazard a guess.GGP negotiated a $65m free carry for 70% of Hav.  They were subsequently loaned $50m to get to your hypothetical 30% of 10moz.. naturally, this created a lot of GGP value in the process.NCM spent $65m just on initial farm in drillingâ¦. Because Havieron is much bigger than expected, more has been spent since on the decline, plus the extra growth drilling, plus the new camp and so on. Truth is, NCM will have spent around $250m to get Havieron (including our loan) to DFS + decline and all works in June/July 2021...After all it will be a producing mine in 12-18 months-â¦The anticipated total âcost of discoveryâ is closer to $25/oz ( assuming 10moz at DFS )Or, if you count the present 4.2 only then $59/oz Ggpâs cost of discovery is in real terms less that NCMs.  This is because GGP didnât pay anything for 30% that initial 4.2moz,  (and quite impossible given the $65m farm in). GGP will also eventually pay something : 160m shares to pacific trends on decision to mine resulting in 3% dilution  , plus the original small cash sum, was it Â£150,000 ? and the cost of GGP drilling Had 1-5  exploration holes, .... for our 3moz , or 6moz , or 10moz or whatever our final share of the 'Champaign cork popping' beast that is Havieron becomes...Interestingly, this all implies NCM will gunning for 20moz plus as a minimum......  Wow!!!Whilst $10/oz  cost of discovery is very cheap in terms of cost of discovery - ie industry leading for very large  T1 surface /open pit deposits - I do agree with Biggles on one thing â¦ NCM will want to try to achieve $10/oz, if possible â¦ And if they do, well, its another BOOM!!!

23 Jan '22,WelshFalcon,RE: Artemis,"Agreed @Bamps. As I see it, if they find anything at Apollo (or anywhere on their patch), then they have to work out how to afford to make it work.Options are:1. raise the cash (HAV over $200m so far, but with no cost for processing plant), loans or dilute, but how much for all the infrastructure plus mine etc?2. JV with NCM. Will NCM want to move as fast as HAV? Would this be a slower operation to bring in ore through HAV infrastructure in  year 10, say? May well depend on the quality of the find!3. JV with RIO? Will this work?4. Raise cash (via dilution?) to prove up the find for sale.5. Merge with GGP.I'm sure there are more options, but however you look at it ARTEMIS will need access to capital in some form or another, this comes at a cost. So 100% ownership is good but it does present challenges.To me it is a speculative shareholding which may or may not come good. The nearby companies that have access to cash (which will include us) may end up with the lions' share of Apollo. That's if it's worth going for, of course (it may be good,but not good enough).I'll put some cash in, but will write it off as 'lost' straight away - if it comes good, Happy Falcon.

23 Jan '22,ProfQuatermass,RE: More Guessing,"I have now corrected this so that the Havieron PFS AISC is right. It is lower than I'd written down in my notes.I have had a go at using the Newcrest / Pretium deal to try to value Havieron. Obviously I am no mathematician. Feel free to contradict me. Newcrest Pretium acquisition. 09.11.2021 Newcrest are spending $2.80bn US for 95%, so the 100 is valued about $2.95bn US. Brucejack has an AISC $743 and is forecast to produce 311k oz pa over 13 years, which is a total of 4,043,000oz Au. The deal values each oz Au @ $730. Havieron PFS suggests the AISC will be $643 and the area in the PFS will produce 160k oz pa over 9 years, which gives a total of 1,440,000oz Au. If we use the $730 oz Au figure on Hav that values Hav at $0.25 or Â£0.18, or Â£0.054 for GGP's share. It will actually be more than this, though, because of Havieron's lower AISC. However, we know that we have 4.2m oz Au eq in the MRE. Applying the $730 oz Au figure to that values Hav at Â£0.55, or Â£0.165 for GGP's share. Double the MRE, which doesn't seem unreasonable, and you get Â£0.33. That is Â£0.039 per m oz Au eq. Regis / Tropicana came out about Â£0.044 per m oz Au. Multiply the average (Â£0.042) by 4.2m oz Au and we get Â£0.176. 10m oz Au eq would mean Â£0.42 and so-on. You can do the maths. Obviously the Brucejack mine is up and running while Havieron isn't yet, but there is obviously a lot of room for our SP to climb. It may take a while, but it will definitely happen. You only need to look at the satellite to see that. Using the Â£0.042 per m oz Au eq figure to value the 5% Newcrest can acquire (0.042 mulitplied by oz Au, divided by 6 to get 5% instead of 30%, multiplied by number of shares (4,206,000,000)). 4.2 m oz Au: Â£123,656,400.006.3 m oz Au: Â£185,484,600.007.4 m oz Au: Â£217,870,800.0010.0 m oz Au: Â£294,420,000.00 Berenberg 5% value at $220,000,000 / Â£165,000,000. Implies 5.5 m oz Au. If we use these figure to value the 25% remaining, that gives these figures per fully diluted share: 4.2 m oz Au: Â£0.156.3 m oz Au: Â£0.227.4 m oz Au: Â£0.2610.0 m oz Au: Â£0.3515.0m oz Au: Â£0.5320.0m oz Au: Â£0.70 Interesting times: looks to me as though at the current price we're sitting on the launchpad.Q",No Opinion,14.1

22 Jan '22,ProfQuatermass,More Guessing,"I have added a bit at the bottom to my go at using the Newcrest / Pretium deal to try to value Havieron to show the possible effect on the share price of the assumed number of ounces in GGP / Newcrests discussions. Obviously I am no mathematician. Feel free to contradict me. Newcrest Pretium acquisition. 09.11.2021 Newcrest are spending $2.80bn US for 95%, so the 100 is valued about $2.95bn US. Brucejack has an AISC $743 and is forecast to produce 311k oz pa over 13 years, which is a total of 4,043,000oz Au. The deal values each oz Au @ $730. Havieron PFS suggests the AISC will be $743 and the area in the PFS will produce 160k oz pa over 9 years, which gives a total of 1,440,000oz Au. If we use the $730 oz Au figure on Hav that values Hav at $0.25 or Â£0.18, or Â£0.054 for GGP's share. However, we know that we have 4.2m oz Au eq in the MRE. Applying the $730 oz Au figure to that values Hav at Â£0.55, or Â£0.165 for GGP's share. Double the MRE, which doesn't seem unreasonable, and you get Â£0.33. That is Â£0.039 per m oz Au eq. Regis / Tropicana came out about Â£0.044 per m oz Au. Multiply the average (Â£0.042) by 4.2m oz Au and we get Â£0.176. 10m oz Au eq would mean Â£0.42 and so-on. You can do the maths. Obviously the Brucejack mine is up and running while Havieron isn't yet, but there is obviously a lot of room for our SP to climb. It may take a while, but it will definitely happen. You only need to look at the satellite to see that. Using the Â£0.042 per m oz Au eq figure to value the 5% Newcrest can acquire (0.042 mulitplied by oz Au, divided by 6 to get 5% instead of 30%, multiplied by number of shares (4,206,000,000)). 4.2 m oz Au: Â£123,656,400.006.3 m oz Au: Â£185,484,600.007.4 m oz Au: Â£217,870,800.0010.0 m oz Au: Â£294,420,000.00 Berenberg 5% value at $220,000,000 / Â£165,000,000. Implies 5.5 m oz Au. If we use these figure to value the 25% remaining, that gives these figures per fully diluted share: 4.2 m oz Au: Â£0.156.3 m oz Au: Â£0.227.4 m oz Au: Â£0.2610.0 m oz Au: Â£0.3515.0m oz Au: Â£0.5320.0m oz Au: Â£0.70 Interesting times: looks to me as though at the current price we're sitting on the launchpad.Q",No Opinion,14.1

Whether the income that can generate for you is worth it vs. the implications is a personal choice. On one hand the total amount on loan is negligible relative to the total shares out there (and corresponding voting rights) and it appears that even a 20million chunk can be quite easily absorbed, so does it do any harm?

This equates to 1.7% of the whole of the SE Crescent / N Breccia. (At the time the resource was estimated to be around 900Mt).2ndQ: ""Â£600m NPV is a massive figure for where we are today and I am very grateful it has remained thus for so long."" Please explain this part...""A:  Initially my maths indicated 9p/share (see below), so I expected around Â£380m NPV at the time. Now we are at Â£600m I am happy because it reflects the upper end of my SP range. Also after our long awaited PFS (which didn't really push us into bigger figures compared to the MMRE (3.4moz)), we in fact only managed to 'firm up' 1.6Moz ore reserve and it is this figure which is reflected in the bottom line, so I am grateful the NPV has stayed around Â£600 (ish).[See the canaccord review link below].3rdQ: ""...how do you come to the figures of 9p/15p,...""A:  All based on the MMRE:  3.4MozAuEq / 90% recovery rate / $1400US (PoG) / 0.73 conversion (US to GBP) / $700 / aisc: $900 / GGP 30%.  This = 9p/share. I changed the aisc's and PoG at the time to look for the best results and eventually over the months I managed to improve on this as the aisc/Pog changed (thank god) to 15p. I was reluctant to mention the lower end of the scale (9p) at the time on this board for fear of reprisals (as has happened today). All of the above were based on the MMRE. In terms of resource, we haven't really ramped up the volume (dissappoiningly) in the PFS except to qualify the ore reserve. Canaccord (below link) reflects this.I expect the MRE2 to achieve well above this 3.4 figure.https://twitter.com/Dannika__/status/1447827742309769220I hope this goes part way to answering your valid questions.I was going to answer Bamps post...but it's late now, I'll try next time I am on maybe, or speak to him via a PM.BestZ",No Opinion,14.1

21 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Moving on,"@Zoros, you say that â MM's can only go on what has been independently declared not on what to expect in future...obviously.âMMâs arenât really interested in what has or hasnât been âindependently declaredâ - they donât really âgo onâ anything beyond  flows. They are neither students nor arbiters of value, and they are price-setters only in the very narrowest sense of the phrase. In reality they are reactive price-takers, looking simply to position their nets where the most fish are swimming. It isnât the market makers that need to be persuaded of the increasing  value of Havieron in order for the price to move upwards - it is the market (investors like you and I) itself. If the market gains confidence from (say) drilling results or MRE updates this will be reflected in buy trades and the MMâs will adjust their prices upwards to the point where equilibrium (balanced two-way flow) is restored; there they can earn their spread without having to risk any of their precious/expensive capital.",No Opinion,14.1

When GGP hits the motherlode, my journey will be over and my target achieved. [Or if NCM successfullybids for GGPâs remaining 25%].  2) To disseminate the plethora of sophisticated and technical data both on and off the bb and translate it so that the majority of us middle of the road investors can stay abreast of what is happening so that they too can understand and complete their own dd.Sometimes news travels fast and leaves the quiet ones behind. We need to capture as many investors as possible, so that they too can enjoy the journey too.My roadmap changes when data changes. It is not set in breccia! It is my best attempt to decipher what is out there and present it in such a way that a newcomer/latecomer can 'catch up', so to speak.I shall continue to contribute until either the majority tell me to stop, or this bb turns sour.Thanks to all constructive posters....you make it all worthwhile.This is what I believe: [I bought in @ 1.5p in May 2019].GGP's only formal declaration of what they have (ie: what the market believes): 1.6Moz ore reserve/3.4MozAuEq. 1.7% of motherlode only declared to date.Based on number of shares on issue / % of mine owned by GGP to date:SP should sit in the range 9p to 15p.

Â£600m NPV is a massive figure for where we are today and I am very grateful it has remained thus for so long. I expected 30+p @ PFS. This was downgraded to 24p by all the brokers because of the almost tripling of the cost of the SLC to a SLOS. I am expecting the MRE2 to produce a minimum of 10Moz with around 3 to 4MozAu (indicated), 7Moz ish (inferred). I am expecting the SP to rise to 25p to reflect this (eventually).I am expecting further gentle rises on good news from each successive MRE, up to the DFS.IF  and it is a massive IF, NCM allows GGP to partner them into the B.U.M. I expect the SP to creep up to 60p+ by the time we start producing gold/Copper.  That is my fundamental calculation.Bonuses en route: Cash in hand for the 5% valuation bonus.Excellent Term sheets.A bid by year end.I must keep reminding myself that there are zillions and zillions of shares out there and the OFFICIAL (not anticipated) resource is small currently. Yes I KNOW it will get bigger and the SP will rise......but to date it hasn't and therefore won't.I am trying very very hard to remain realistic about this share but it is like whispering into a hurricane sometimes with the relentless ramping that goes on 24/7 with this BB.I am pro GGP, pro Hav, but people must allow common sense to enter the equation from time to time, surely?Best wishes to all.",No Opinion,14.1

It won't be something we can refuse, both NCM/GGP are tied to this process.  1) Newcrest want to agree the option exercise price by mid feb 2022, 2) If Newcrest/GGP do not mutually agree on a Fair Market Value by this date then both parties put forward their own valuations 3) If both valuations are within 10% of each other, then the average will be considered the valuation for Newcrest to exercise their 5% option. 4) If there is a greater than 10% disparity, an independent expert is brought in to choose which one of the estimates is fair market value, so I assume that is the price that needs to be paid by Newcrest. 5) Newcrest then has 30 business days to exercise its option to acquire the additional 5%. 6) Should they choose to go ahead, then proceeds from the exercise will be used to repay the outstanding balance of the existing loan we have from Newcrest.HOWEVER, whomever replied to my email (below***) pointed out that GGP/NCM can agree to anything they want as long as both of them are happy to change things, think of it as a framework to encourage professionalism and sensible approaches.***Your summary of the 5% option exercise, fair market valuation process and timeline is accurate.

I'm just going to react to the FMV outcome than build a strong expectation of what the end result should be - but I'm more excited than concerned personally.

What their specific LT outcome situation  remains to be see... but I note the strong relationship between 'stock on loan' and the GGP SP . And I note that recently since november, (and before the placing) they were constantly having to increase the 'stock on loan'. The SP was broadly flat, since November the placing.  Meanwhile the stock on loan has increased from 17m to over circa 50m plus.  I note the all significant LTH are entirely and fully 'dug in' and will not be moved by market games.

Be interested to see Shaun's response to this too... surprise mid morning RNS anyone?    That would be fun.Overnight, we witnessed the end of the crypto bull market.  Many children were harmed, in the process. The catastrophic effects of trading Bitcoin on leverage, laid bare... As Peter Schiff says, the risk is, it will eventually return to nothing.  Because, other than 'the network effect' otherwise known as ""greater fool theory"" , isn't that what it is - in essence? - nothing.I expect we'll see significant in flows into gold as a consequence.  At 1830 we sit above an historically signicant support line.  The chart is looking better by the day... We also witnessed  spectacular crash in Netflix overnight.  the continued and brutal rotation from growth to value steamrollers on.Which brings me to JPM.  I find myself partially agreeing with Starbright on this occasion.   Whilst I am now proven correct beyond all reasonable doubt... . Shorting 'does  exist' , blatantly. I am cheered by the fact that they are not hurting us really.... it is they are required to keep increasing their positions.Presumably, being the investment arm, they are doing it for an UHNW client, maybe for multiple clients, or for their funds.  But it is not the bank itself, it's the asset management side doing it.  It could be as simple as a technical long/short fund that as taken the short based on specific technicals (not fundamentals) ...I cannot see much profit in it for them.  But given the present SP I can see risk. As rick rule suggests a short on the wrong side of the fundamentals is a short I like. Brightstar Asserted:  It could (speculative guess for discussion only..!) be that the recent 18.1m trade at 15.1p was their opening, with subsequent trades taking them to the 20.x m requiring disclosure on 19/1/21. No-one knows, but it is tempting to link this trade with the disclosure.   It could be they were laddering this all along and started to lose control ,  increasing a position taking them over the 0.5%  threshold. It doesn't mean they are correct.   TBF it Just feels like they are on the back foot: It reeks of scare tactics and the like. Regardless, the battle yesterday i suspect, probably involved another short position being liquidated.  And it appears the JPM position has already been 'absorbed', thus we patiently await further good news from Havieron. As Ben,  Callum and Frazer , reveal whatever secrets occupied so much of their time recently. Very much looking forward ...And as Gold rises - GDXJ buy GGP .

And I mean badly. They were gunning for sub 12p, but the drastic leap to 17p effectively created a margin call... So they had no choice but to doubled down; with the 18m ""MEGASHOMB"" ..... 18m sold at 16.5p oooof in pure desperation ... surely that was going to work?   But no...  it didn't buyers just lapped it up... knowing that Newcrest are about to pay us handsomely for the 5%.Now they have circa 50m to buy back.  So, who blinks first?   And when do. How hard they are forced to close out...

20 Jan '22,Mark70,Newcrest on the up,"Key pointsNewcrest Mining share price rallies 6.3% as investors move on a rising gold spot priceGeopolitical tensions and the potential for rate hikes are also putting wind in gold minersâ sails todayThe mining giant is expected to release its quarterly results on 28 JanuaryThe Newcrest Mining Ltd (ASX: NCM) share price is glistening with a green complexion on Thursday.At the time of writing, shares in Australiaâs largest listed gold mining company are trading at $25.47, up 6.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO) is down 0.05% in afternoon trade.The Newcrest share price is having its best day since May 2020 when it gained 6.7%. However, the $19 billion gold-mining giant is moving without any new announcements out today.If we step back and take a broader look at the gold sector, we see that Newcrest isnât alone in its joyous performance. For reference, hereâs how other gold miners are doing:Northern Star Resources Ltd (ASX: NST) up 11%Evolution Mining Ltd (ASX: EVN) up 8.5%Chalice Mining Ltd (ASX: CHN) up 6.1%This information would suggest the reason behind Newcrestâs move is due to a sector-wide catalyst. It is likely the strengthening in the spot gold price overnight that is causing todayâs momentum.According to CNBC, gold rallied 1.7% to US$1,842.9 an ounce. The upward move places the precious metal at a 2-month high. In turn, the Newcrest share price is benefitting from it.",No Opinion,14.1

The session peak of $1,843.50 also marked a two-month high.Technical charts indicated that Comex goldâs next stop could be $1,860.âThe $1,830 had been a major wall of resistance for gold longs and the successful demolition of it puts them on the strongest footing since November,â said Sunil Kumar Dixit, technical strategist at skcharting.com. âSo long as gold keeps above $1,825, then the $1,860 target is very possible.âThe near 4% rally in gold since the end of November has also lent a new glow to the yellow metalâs prowess as an inflation-hedging tool amid the worst U.S. price pressures in 40 years. In terms of absolute gain, Wednesdayâs advance in Comex gold was the biggest in a day in more than a month â the previous being a 1.9% jump on Dec. 15.Gold has always been branded as an inflation hedge but it failed to live up to that tag several times last year as the Dollar Index and U.S. Treasury yields rallied instead on expectations of rate hikes.The Federal Reserve, or Fed, dropped interest rates to virtually zero after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, keeping them at between zero and 0.25% over the past 20 months. But officials at the central bank say a series of rate hikes will be needed now, to counter inflation as prices of almost everything have soared from the lows of the Covid-19 crisis due to trillions of dollars of pandemic relief spending, higher wage payout and supply chain disruptions.News of rate hikes have typically been negative for gold, and this was somewhat reflected last year as the yellow metal closed 2021 down 3.6% for its first annual dip in three years, and for the sharpest slump since 2015.But some analysts think that if the U.S. inflation theme remains strong through 2022, then gold could even retrace 2020âs record highs above $2,100 â a peak which, incidentally, came on the back of worries about price pressures as the United States began its biggest budget deficit with the onset of the pandemic.âGiven the calls for even more rate hikes this year than markets are pricing in, not to mention larger individual increases than we've seen for many years, perhaps we are seeing some inflation hedging from traders that don't think central banks are doing enough to bring price pressures down,â said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.",Strong Buy,13.9

So fair value (which it would probably only get to on liquidation) would be 1.5 x GGP plus the small amount for the other investments. It seems to trade at around 40-50% disc to its NAV.

I can visualize the slotting together of all the drilling targets to produce the definitive jigsaw of the Havieron and surrounding area in a relatively short couple of years time frame and then elsewhere at our other prospects. With a little luck it will be great if we can eventually be large enough to self fund all of this leading to large future profits.

Believe in drilling a hole, understanding that, reflecting on it, recalibrating understanding of the region and then going back in.- Very much exploration built up from 1st principles and careful analysis, thinks over time this is the best way to create value for shareholders.***End***",No Opinion,14.0

Massive re rate Incoming,"Some comments from our CEIO in regards to exploration last year:Shaun - InvestorMeet PFS Q&A  - Oct 12 2021Paddy G asks which of the growth targets excites you the most - the eastern breccia, the north-west pod or the external targets like Zipa, Havieron North and Meco? Oh well that's a that's a that's a ripping question! Look to some extent I think the lowest risk targetâ¦.I'll answer it in two parts - the lowest risk target is (or three parts  rather), the lowest risk part target is that north west corridor kind of bringing together these high grade areas that we're seeing and knitting together this trend that we're seeing in that northwest corridor that brings that fresh air together -  I think that's really exciting - it's going to take time to drill but yeah it's very positive in what we're seeing.That eastern breccia is just extraordinary you know, to find widths of you know 200 meters sitting in the shadow of Havieron (referring to drill intervals), different geo-chem signature is spectacular. Yeah, I can't help but be really excited about that you know when you already have an ore body and then you've got you know what looks like a mineralised extension of some 650, 750 meters sitting next to it - yeah wowee thatâs good fun - so yeah looking forward to drilling that out.The option value that the banker in me always enjoys a bit of option value, sitting in those proximal targets, uh so we do want to drill them. I think we have similar on the Scallywag tenements that sit next door - but I think all three of them bring you know different stories to the growth and that multi-layered growth profile that we have at Havieron - it all adds to why this is a world-class system. ***continued***",No Opinion,14.0

Also applying to other jurisdictions.- Adopted use of two Truscan units at Red Chris (XRF instruments) as part of core logging process to photograph and scan cores to give real-time metal values at the time of drilling to enable real-time decision making in regards to drill planning and rig location.- This is helping to circumvent issues being experienced through industry wide assay delays and turnarounds experienced over the past few months.- Advantages include being able to âlog smarterâ, geoâs have the geochemistry to hand before starting and theyâre also using machine learning to identify basic structures lithology to help focus their efforts and move away from metre by metre logging to speed up the process.- Closes section by mentioning theyâre doing a similar exercise or just starting that journey up at Haverion.*Deliver value through growth and exploration strategies - Through three pillars:-- Partnership: most of their projects are JVâs or option deals, it is their preferred method as helps them to capture good ground and work with really good groups to share knowledge and also learn from, are always happy to review projects with anyone as constantly looking for something new.- Leverage off exploration DNA & Technology - Mining capability is key as not only can they explore deeper but can also turn these all around.*Answering a question from the host about dealing with challenges from increased cost of mining services and the lab delays - The 21-day turnaround they aim for is currently out to 40-60 days like most others.- Another industry challenge is obtaining good drillers, geologists and support staff, so they are helping to develop the next generation of personnel.- Shortage of resources and price pressure really keeps them moving.***end***",No Opinion,14.0

Slide also shows intercept drills below 4400m RL with plus 1-gram intercepts, so gives you a feel for the extent of the mineralisation.- Deposit is associated with variable amounts of sulphide quartz and carbonate that forms in brushes or vein infill in a typical Hav style mineralisation.*Growth program in place - Testing series of exploration targets to support potential resource growth in three main areas over the next 12 months.- SE Crescent Deeps (HG open at depth): drilling sitting below resource is still open with significant intercepts, trying to define extent of the higher grade and continuity of mineralisation- Northern and Eastern Breccia Targets (Open HG Mineralisation):  NW Hav trending corridor hosting two zones of higher-grade mineralisation in N Breccia and NW pod. Drilling around these to define footprint of the higher grade and to see if the corridor links into a bigger single zone of mineralisation. Work on Eastern Breccia is early stage with only a handful of holes into it so they donât currently understand the geological controls and dimensions of system, but encouraged by some good intercepts and presence of HG which could indicate the presence of an additional NW corridor, currently testing this concept.- 3 new targets within Hav proximity: with potentially similar Geophysical properties, so again the question is, are there more Havâs floating around Hav? - The targets are named:  Zipa (Gravity), Havieron North (Magnetics) and Meco (Gravity) - image link below:https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1422341968009605121/photo/1*** continued***",No Opinion,14.0

It must be enormous!!All the indications are that recent drilling discoveries at Havieron are constantly upping the value due to the unending expansion both at depth and horizontally along with some exceptional grades etc.No wonder Sandeep and Shaun are chomping at the bit.Be prepared for the agreed monumental valuation and a game changing offer to GGP for the extra 5%.

So I bring this calculation to you (one in particular: Mumbo Jumbo) and I ask that you constructively dismantle my theory:By the time the assessments are made by NCM/GGP regarding fair value for the 5%, each will have in their possession ALL of the MRE2 results. They may even have even more advanced data on Hav (but this isn't taken into account below). Because we are all second guessing the outcome at this stage, I have taken the intel from the two brokers calling the shots regarding the outcome of the MRE2 simply because they are nearer the action than anyone else I know.....right?So please stay with me on this arithmetic journey and then feel free to dismiss it at your leisure:Firstly, NCM/GGP are working out fair value for 5% of the MINE, not GGP's share.2 x brokers are saying the MRE2 should elevate the SP to 25p 9round figures).This will make GGP worth 4.2Bn (shares) x 25p. This equals: 1.05Bn.GGP (at this point in time) will own 30% of the mine, making the mine: Â£3.5Bn (GBP).5% of the mine: Â£175mn.What I have done here is make the starting point for negotiations: Â£175mn and this is taking what is formally known to exist underground, post MRE2.Whether the valuation takes into account future prospects,,,nobody knows.Now, ironically this Â£175mn happens to coincide with Canaccords: $220mn....how strange! IM humble O......Â£175mn HAS to be the starting point if GGP is to receive a fair valuation for their 5% of the mine. The future 25% will of course have to be valued using the then parameters, probably after a series of MRE;s have been produced, all the way to the DFS.So by the time GGP pays back their $50mn debt and also pays/sets aside the Capex for the starter mine ($73mn), GGP will have a kewl Â£85 million pounds to add to their existing Â£16 making a wopping Â£100mn+ green drinking vouchers in the bank ready for egional exploration....wey hey!Mumbo - I take people at face value and I believe you 'appear' to be an OK chappie (at this stage).

17 Jan '22,Dip666,RE: Implication of $228m Million for 5%,"Frankly Mumbo, I don't think any of us posting here have the relevant experience in authoring valuations to come to an educated guess on a number and as StuWoo just pointed out, we have the random aspect of negotiations being between NCM/GGP and they only go to 3rd party if they can't agree or come to valuations within 10% of each other. Both are free to agree something completely random as long as they are on the same page, but the MRE will help evaluate some aspect of what will feed the more data lead calculations. The code makes plenty of room for speculations and assumptions for exploration targets/ground BTW and both companies WILL have to keep the code in mind when building their numbers in case things go to arbitration as such.  Exploration side of things may be valued more favourably than some think due to the fact that we HAVE previous success in the mining lease and others in the region over the years, infrastructure nearby etc. with Telfer as some more positive points. The problem is what is 'fair' isn't clear to us inexperienced observers, probably would be if we worked in the industry on that side of things but I bet our SRK consultant Simon Hanrahan has a good idea as will staff on NCM's side. I expect sensible approaches by both teams and a value that will be a decent outcome or perhaps something completely left-field as StuWoo suggests.I'll be happy if we can cover the existing loan and all of our development costs for the starter money, icing on the cake if change for other exploration spend too. Owning 25% of Havieron which could realistically IMO grow to a 20MoZ plus resource is fine with me, most of us were cognisant of the 5% option, while the timing does not favour us, we may well become far better capitalised for the path to production with less/no need for bank funding at this stage  -  which is no bad thing IMO.",No Opinion,14.0

17 Jan '22,StuWoo,RE: Implication of $228m Million for 5%,"At the end of the day, the deal is about NCM getting their hands on a further 5% of Havieron. Technically, we could jut say ""Buy us a pint and you can have it.""The ridiculousness of that suggestion is to serve a point. Whilst all the talk is about NCM paying fair market value (FMV) for it, and both sides having to agree to a figure, or agree to be made to agree to a figure, by a third party. Establishing, as these posts make clear, what actually is FMV is not easy - it can be looked at from many different angles, has to factor in some known unknowns and maybe even some unknown, unknowns too. So why not avoid it?Firstly let's just assume the MRE will be upgraded - it is a year since the last set of figures were used, we've had hit after hit since, so if the market is really true, based on facts, our SP should rise organically on that. Park that point for a moment.Because doing this 5% value deal is complicated and potentially fraught with the risk of having one or both partners not being happy bunnies. There are other ways to do deals.NCM could for argument's sake, wipe off our debt and bung us a nominal say $30 million for us go exploring in elephant country for for some more hits in our 100% owned tenements which, they would have first option to JV with us on. We may also need to negotiate a cut of future realised growth or other such monetary bonus. Or perhaps a reduction in our share of longer term cap ex (although gold will be pouring by then, we'll have revenue and Shaun's banky friends will be willing to lend).But the point being, a deal like that makes GGP better off, certainly more valuable but avoids NCM having to pay a potentially massive TMV (which they don't and won't want to) it also negates what we get as a mechanism by which to value us. Going from having a $50m debt to having $30m in the bank, combined with a higher MRE that still is nowhere near going to be an accurate reflection of what will eventually be the overall value of Havieron, plus (I agree with Hydro/Paddy about) Zipa being a hit too, should make the SP rise nicely to somewhere nearer current Broker averaged values in the mid 20s.That way everyone's a winner and an impossible calculation (the true long term value of Hav) is avoided thus not negatively affecting our SP or from NCM's perspective, their bank balance. Most importantly good faith between the two parties is maintained.Just a thought...",No Opinion,14.0

To get around this in the gold space the traders on COMEX use liquidity providers (holders of physical) by leasing (lending) gold to shorts. The problem is that more and more traders are wanting delivery in gold not $s (8 tons last month) and the liquidity providers are reluctant to settle so are pulling liquidity. Will this be the catalyst for a higher POG? no one knows. I see it as just another tailwind in the space. The LBMA(10 times bigger than COMEX) has delayed implementation until 2023 so the effect will not be felt this year but the traders will be preparing towards the end of 2022.

I have had a great run on Sareum (SAR) a bio research company where I invested at 1p sold some at 9p but now sit on the balance of my holding at 4.4p (not dissimilar to GGP share price pattern).

Also as far as GGP goes - itâs full of such great researchers that I canât add much of value! I just wanted to say though that Iâm so sorry Mattyboy.  As a parent of a son whoâs going to need care for ever I know what youâve sacrificed in your life to look after your dad - but I think by doing that you can be at peace for ever as youâve truly done your best and made such a difference to his last years.   Also as someone who depends on carers - good carers are very hard to find and always in demand and appreciated so much by people whose loved ones they are looking after.  Just wish they got paid better and hopefully that will happen one day because they deserve it and work very hard for it.  I donât know what Iâd do without them and itâs one of my motivations for investing and when Iâm no longer around - to provide for my son (and other children - better add that)!  I hope you donât have to sell your shares and as others have said with the right legal advice Iâm sure you wonât have to.  Good luck.  Also Tom - so happy for you as well - now you can enjoy 2022 without any worry - must be a load off your mind. As far as GGP goes I think thereâs so much to look forward to over the coming weeks and I canât wait for SP to begin to reflect that.  I find those not invested just underestimate it so much.  Itâs such an exciting share to be in with so many possibilities.

Using a simple third pricing, Third for the gold in ground, third to extract it out of the ground and a third profit.Divide $1800 by a third is $600 * that by 10m ounces ( conservative) and you $300m without anything else.2. People say the copper will pay for the mining, thus making the gold profit free ( minimum of$300m) in my eyes.3.

At 57 and with 6 years of personal caring experience, you'll be snapped up by many an agency, I'm sure.  Even if it's only to give you an income whilst you wait for the SP to rise and give you the rewards you so rightly deserve.  My father in law recently lost his wife and I'm amazed at how tricky the law is with even his spouse-to-spouse Will, so do make sure you take all the legal advice you can get, especially if a firm offers a free first consultation as a starting point.  Also make sure you get out and about even if only for a walk - the stark quiet of an empty house is what is upsetting my fia the most, so human contact of any kind can be very beneficial.

13 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Reply from Greatland - Assessing the 5% FMV,"I expect the JV partners to reach agreement on the 5% without (publicly at least!) rocking the boat that is sailing smoothly. The price* may be a little lower than some are hoping for, because future development potential will have to be âriskedâ one way or another. It may - as I have proposed previously - be better to consider the 5% as the last instalment of the farm-in rather than as an advance on the final 25%. But I am optimistic that the deal will be a material positive for GGPâs balance sheet, funding position and prospects.The âGated Feasibility Study to Executionâ in q4 looks to me like the point at which the real excitement will start, because it is then that the project will be dressed to the nines for capital raising purposes. We will find out how wholesale capital providers (debt & equity) are prepared to value the project, and I am sure that NCM will throw all it has behind this. I think their own interests will be best served by maximising value perception at this point.At the end of the day the only sure way for GGP to realise the âfull valueâ of the 25% will be to hold that interest for the long term, and it has every opportunity to do this.  It is possible that the recent hires indicate that this is the plan. In any case they will be crucial if/when GGP has to raise capital to stand its corner. If (as I suspect) NCM really really want 100% then GGP may even have an opportunity to exit at a premium.

This in itself should keep both parties sensible IMO, really makes it random bringing in a 3rd party - why risk the unknown as I noted earlier as you can get some wide variations in value, personally were I Sandeep or Shaun - I'd try to come to an agreed price within 10% to avoid the random nature of a 3rd party - and this is possible if both sides are realistic about both the known and unknown. As you say, SD could indeed sell Hav but personally I doubt it is something he wants to do, I do think a few things would need to factor into him being convinced of this option:1/ NCM would really have to put forward something extra extra special to convince him of selling Hav IMO:- he knows how rare a discovery such as Havieron is and the ability the revenue will give him to build up a solid company in the years ahead2/ We hit elsewhere so he figures he could use the funds to help develop our own asset, but again, surely the revenue from Havieron and a mix of bank funding could achieve this?3/ Or he feels he can buy a particular asset he has earmarked from proceeds of a sale perhaps, but as above, in time the revenue from Havieron and bank funding also allows this?",No Opinion,13.9

13 Jan '22,Bamps21,RE: Havieron lookalikes,"In terms of Olympic Dam-type mineralisation the relationship between gravity and magnetic sources is comparable, however the amplitude of the gravity anomaly is considerably lower at Tabletop1 (0.5mgal vs >10.0mgal). Similarly the density contrast is lower, which suggests that if the Tabletop1 gravity anomaly is due to haematitic alteration, the alteration is not as intense as at Olympic Dam.In terms of Telfer-style mineralisation it has been suggested that the gravity anomaly may arise from sulfides within sediments above an intrusive source. While this is possible â with a density contrast of 0.05g/cc indicating that approximately 1.1% sulfides could give rise to the gravity anomaly, it is noted that no gravity anomaly is evident over Telfer, nor is it directly underlain by a magnetic intrusive (Sexton, 1994).Regardless, there is a very interesting empirical relationship between the magnetic and gravity anomalies. In order to determine the source of the gravity anomaly a hole should be drilled to a vertical depth of at least 1000 metres, and possibly to 1200 metres, into the core of the dense source.",No Opinion,14.0

13 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Basel 3,"Thank you @Speedy. I am interested by this because BAC is one of the largest holdings in a fund (Polar Capital Global Financials Trust) in which I hold shares. I understand completely that banks make mistakes and also that they havenât always disclosed their positions properly, so have tried to apply a âreasonableness testâ with an open mind. BAC reported* FY20 net income of USD18bn in its last annual report, and shareholdersâ equity of USD273bn. On the simple grounds of scale alone, the notion that BAC has a net exposure to the PoG such that its entire annual net income could be wiped out by just a 5-10% move in the PoG is unlikely. And BACâs balance sheet just isnât large enough to conceal an exposure >100% of shareholdersâ equity. It would be like trying to hide a haystack in a sewing box. From the perspective of an investor (or a capital adequacy regulator...) BAC would be nothing more than a leveraged play on PoG if the USD300bn exposure were real. Remember also that JPM would have to consider recoverability of the asset in its own financial statements.I looked a little deeper to see if (as suggested by by @Blindfaith01) this might be a hedged arrangement, in which case the net exposure could be substantially less than USD300bn, but I canât see any evidence of this in BACâs financial statements. BAC reports** gross notional exposures to commodity contracts (traded+OTC) of USD36bn for swaps, USD73bn for futures and USD49bn for options. These figures are the gross aggregates (assets PLUS liabilities) across all commodities to all clients. Thereâs nowhere in there to hide a USD300bn single-client single-commodity contract like the one described. And BACâs market risk VaR*** (a measure of potential gains and losses) for commodities contracts shows average exposure of just USD6bn.Whilst I am sure you have received (and reported here) the info regarding the USD300bn exposure in good faith, I ask that you re-examine it critically. It can ONLY be correct if there is an enormous collaborative cover-up within BAC and JPM involving the trading, accounting, risk management and compliance professionals of both banks at all levels of seniority. Also that this cover-up successfully conceals the existence of an exposure greater than BAC shareholdersâ equity from external auditors and regulators.The arrangement involving 800million oz of silver referenced by @Droverman would be worth USD18.4bn. This is more believable given the size of the sums involved.I am - as always - v happy to look at this again if you have other info.*Table 1 Pg50**Note 3 Pg132,***Table 44 Pg103  https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_92190146074dbdd28317857fd60b4386/bankofamerica/db/867/9129/annual_report/BAC_2020_Annual_Report.pdf",No Opinion,13.95

This suggests that all or most of the dense source lies above the source of the magnetic anomaly, which has been modelled to lie 1250 metres beneath the suface.While the density contrast between host rocks and anomalous source at Tabletop 1 is quite low, as is the surface response (when compared with the response at Olympic Dam), the gravity anomaly is thought to arise from alteration and/or mineralisation above a magnetic intrusive. There is considerable size potential. Hence this anomaly is a quality exploration target. The depth of the sources of the responses may however be prohibitive, as a +1000 metre deep hole would be required to test this target.Tabletop 2 a lower amplitude 0.1-0.15 milligal gravity anomaly was delineated directly over the magnetic anomaly. The source of this response appears to lie between 400m and 700m of surface, and primarily above the source of the magnetic anomaly. Since this target is shallower than Tabletop 1, yet its density contrast is similar, it is thought to be a higher quality target for alteration and/or mineralisation above a magnetic intrusion.Hence it is recommended that the nature of the sources of the magnetic and gravity anomalies at Tabletop 2 be determined with a 600-800m deep drill hole. The results from such a hole could be used to reprioritise the prospectivity of the Tabletop 1 anomalies.Gravity surveying over the Tabletop 3 magnetic anomaly failed to delineate a discrete anomalous response over or adjacent to the modelled source of the magnetic anomaly. Hence no further work at this target is recommended.",Strong Buy,13.95

What they pay will not be the true âmarket valueâ  as the asset is not going onto the market so we will never know what âtrue market valueâ is, it will be based on a theoretical exercise -  the same as in getting your house valued for 250k, which will be based on market comparable sales elsewhere within the geographical vicinity, but then when you put it on the market you get 300k because you had lots of bidders who really want it.

What I do find strange though is that nobody confirmed one way or the other whether that 18M trade on Monday was a buy or sell.It seems a bit of a coincidence though that there are now 18M more shares out on loan now, don't you think !After reading a post of yours from earlier today you said,""NCM/whoever looking to drive the price down, paid gangs of shorter trolls posting in collusion with the owners of the LSE bulletin boards, desperate shorters losing control, corrupt but colluding market-makers, trades âfired-inâ in response to posts on this 'board etc. It has made for entertaining reading at times. But it is no more than uneducated speculation, and should be dismissed by serious investors"".Why should they be dismissed ?, for all anyone knows on this Bulletin Board, you yourself could be part of this shorting gang, and by telling everyone to dismiss the idea, maybe it's your way of deflecting attention away from yourselves.You suddenly appear here, with your eloquently written post trying to gain the trust of the board, that your font of knowledge is far superior to the average punter here.

I say tell that to BT shareholders where 6% of the company was bought as the share price declined , after the buyer went from 0-12 % in one notification.just my opinion of course ,and it might just be PIâs buying and selling and there is no accumulation going on at all.",No Opinion,14.0

Once again, Paddy posts evidence that very talented people are joining the team, people who would not struggle to find employment elsewhere and probably not looking to be employed in a job for a few weeks before a takeover transpires  - as no guarantee they would all keep their jobs and would receive very little redundancy pay. If I was interested in a job there and being interviewed I'd certainly have done my homework and asked the question of Shaun of his outlook for GGP before considering accepting a job if successful. He is very obviously looking to replicate the success he helped build as part of the senior leadership while at Northern Star Resources  - but with himself at the helm at GGP. The StockBox interview last July assured me his background and understanding of the industry is sound and thorough and he is proving to be an excellent CEO IMO.While I expect that a good 5% valuation, more excellent drill results  (particularly if positive on the E.Breccia and new targets) and the MRE will help us return to a far better SP, I do think we need sentiment and money to return to the sector (which it will IMO in 2022) to really see us fly again.

Indeed, new energy research provider BloombergNEF estimates that the global transition will require ~$173 trillion in energy supply and infrastructure investment over the next three decades with renewable energy expected to provide 85% of our energy needs by 2050.But nowhere is the outlook brighter than the metals industry.Clean energy technologies require more metals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. According to a recent Eurasia Review analysis,  prices for copper, nickel, cobalt, and lithium could reach historical peaks for an unprecedented, sustained period in a net zero emissions scenario, with total value of production rising more than four-fold for the period 2021-2040, and even rivaling the total value of crude oil production.https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Big-Money-Is-Eyeing-Metals-Over-Oil-As-Mining-Assets-Soar.html",Strong Buy,14.2

11 Jan '22,SpadesAspade,Illiquid share,"There has been much talk from some on this BB who say they are ex money men who worked in the market. They talk about how the MM's try and find a price where they can find a trade.IMO with just over 4 billion shares in issue they ain't making a good job of it. This share has become so illiquid over the last 9 months it's untrue.MM's, If you want a liquid share where you will find folk willing to trade, then try raising the price to a point where people will feel comfortable in letting go of a few of their holding. It's no coincidence that back in October when we briefly went back to around 22/23p that the trades then were at 80/90 million per day, and not 7/10 million per day we currently see.The only sells I see going through are from traders who are trying to make a weeks wage. Most investors here, are just sat patiently waiting for the day this turns around and reverses this monotonous trend we find ourselves in.For me personally, I just switch off to this trend. I am comfortable in the knowledge that I have purchased the shares I need to truly transform my families lives for the better, and if I have to wait a couple of years for that to come to fruition, then so be it.All you naysayers who come here talking this share down, just so you can hopefully get in lower, because you want what we already have, can go swivel. You ain't getting any of my winning lottery tickets. Not now, not tomorrow, not next week, month or year.I just find it funny seeing what tactics and falsehoods you guys come up with next to try and convince some to sell up. My advice to some of you who don't know what you have bought into, is to just ignore these charlatans and ask yourself why is it that 99% of the top 150 shareholders have never sold one share and why some continue to add to their holding.Yes it's difficult watching this stagnant SP range of 14/16p, but this will end sooner than you think when the next MRE is produced. We have a further 90,000 meters of drilling to look forward to by July, not infill drilling but growth drilling, which hopefully will prove up even more mineralisation, thus expanding the already massive footprint of this world class find.Not long to wait now for a nice rerate in our fortunes.

Happy to hear them as it makes me re-examine my own position/thoughts.As it stands, my own opinion remains as it did - NCM need this to get to production ASAP. What better way to do that than to fund your junior partner to production/free cash flow? (Obviously while getting another 5% of a world class asset).This is the only share Iâve ever told friends/family to look at but Iâve always said to look at it as a 25% net asset, (ie 30% with debt/dilution or 25% with no associated debt), and roughly 4.25bn shares in issue in the end.As far as the MRE2 moving by a few weeks from Decâ21 to possibly Feb â22 - Iâd rather that date with a fuller picture than earlier with less of one. Just my own preference.Assuming no shenanigans, (Iâm aware that one can never rule them out - including a fair chunk of what was posted yesterday), and the continued smooth progression of the partnership then GGP will be in free cash flow in two years from now, (and counting!).I know many are unhappy with the current share price and thatâs entirely understandable but while I shanât proffer theories about shorting/suppression the languishing SP can be at least partly explained by the Lassonde curve. But what usually takes 10-15 years on that timeline is going to be achieved within 5 years by NCM/GGP - and weâre almost 3 years into thatâ¦â¦â¦..Risk is pretty minimal and the prize is huge, (in my opinion, of course!).But two of my favourite Shaun Day quotes from October/November give me confidence that my investment will be handsomely rewarded in a relatively short time in mining terms.âHavieron becoming a mine is the worst kept secret in the industryâOctober investor meets company growth presentation Q&AâItâs elephant country.

This process can't even begin until GGP & NCM have put forward their presentations and calculations which look like they will be revealed in mid-February. My question is how long do people estimate this assessment will take? Surely it will be a decent amount of time. Weeks? More than a month? I do realise that it may not get to that stage and some have been views that as both companies work so closely together that the most likely scenario is that the two valuations will be close enough to not require FMV.

11 Jan '22,YNWA91,RE: Mightly Oaks from little acorns grow!,"For the 5% I think NCM will pay slightly higher than they are happy with and lower than we will be happy with, but what the market will think is about right. When it comes to the 25% I think NCM will definitely look to buy it in the next 12-18 months. Donât know what makes people think they would buy all of ggp really the JV set up seems to work just fine for them. I think they will pay a decent amount for the 25%, which a few on here will moan about. Some people seem to be getting slightly carried away because it has been such an amazing journey upto now. I seen a few yesterday saying they wouldnât entertain a takeover bid of 50p per share. Get real this share was 1.2p a few years ago when I invested, that sort of return is like a fairy tail of aim, you are much more likely to lose every penny you have than finding that sort of return on this or any other market. Obviously many havenât been invested that long but itâs not upto NCM to inflate the price so new investors make a few bags as well. I think a good price for the 25% will be agreed and the deal will include jvs for further exploration on similar terms as the current one for hav et al, as upto now we are a one hit wonder, yet if we find another feasible project we will have a proven track record with a reputation to match but with plenty of cash in the bank so we canât be held at ransom.

10 Jan '22,Dip666,RE: Imminent Bid - Thread Removed,"If you're trying to ascertain a potential value for the 5% option SB then you need to do more than use a comparative transaction basis to find a median, SRK created a range of values in their valuation for Kharmagtai from which they could best ascertain the mid-range value as being 'fair' for instance but the range was very wide. They based their decision to use the mid-range value on factors such as the development status of the project  - not because it was the mid-point. From memory they went with a range above the median for the exploration targets, SRK also used a Metal Transaction Ratio approach due to the Poly Metallic aspect in the example I broke down last week.As with Valmin Code aligned valuations, it might also be prudent to ensure you undertake secondary methods of comparison to support the primary method you use (not just Market, but Income and Cost based approaches as per the Valmin Code)  -  as both parties valuations may be assessed along these lines potentially if a 3rd party is brought in to determine which valuation is closer to FMV, (failing them coming to final valuations within 10% of each other.Also as SaS has pointed out, your constant focus on communicating  'issues' with tax perhaps relates to having never run a company/your own company.

Being a realist there is very little value until there is another discovery, and then it needs to be proven, but a lot of risk in all except Havieron.When the sale of the25% (as I think it must) comes I am sure the resultant will be a reasonable pay-out, as I have said the way of the would is that the people making the decisions will want to fill their pension pots and more asap. I have just read BAMPS contribution titled GOLDERN GOOSE.Does this alter the relationship with NCM, I think no, the other JV etc still continue, and the relationship would be enhanced if there is a good settlement on price, both 5 and 25% with a fair royalty agreement.Whatever happens the BOD will do better than PIâs in this",No Opinion,14.95

10 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Imminent Bid - Thread Removed,"Here's how I see this playing out. Very hypothetical, so not to be viewed as anything other than for discussion..!1. NCM will want 100% of Hav because it will secure their existing interest & immediate  (5-7yrs) future2. They will agree a price for the 5% that the market will say is too high, and wizards on this board will say is too low3. Post DFS everyone will know what is required to fund CapEx etc.4. At this point NCM will take a firmer hold on GGP's nuts by requiring GGP to confirm that the funding for its 25% is in place5. GGP will have been working to assemble a financing package comprising an equity placing and some bank debt6. The equity placing will allow GGP to onboard institutional capital and partially de-risk its febrile shareholder register7. NCM will offer an alternative - a proposal to buy the remaining 25% either in one hit or in tranches over time8. SD & the GGP board will have a proper decision to make at this pointThe biggest risk to GGP shareholders is that the DFS and ensuing vice-like grip on their balls arrives, and the financing package for their 25% isn't really a runner. This may not be down to weaknesses in the investment case - it could be an outcome of exogenous factors like equity market volatility / PoG / whatever. In this circumstance NCM will make GGP a lower ""offer that they can't refuse"" and fund the CapEx themselves against a 100% interest.So I see GGP's main focus for 2022 as ensuring that they are 100% ready and able to front their 25% share of the ""full"" capex for the development of Hav when the bell is rung. This is why SD has recruited proper expertise at senior management level; they have to be credible as an investment proposition. If GGP has financing in place, it'll take a much higher offer from NCM to prise the 25% from their grasp. I do not think that there is any real ""imminent"" danger of a bid. Both company's needs are better served by a trade sale of the JV interests at the right time. And any such bid would subject to horrible execution risk - as amply demonstrated by discourse on this 'board today - because of GGP's immature shareholder base.I remain a happy holder and would be comfortable adding at the current price level if I wanted a larger position.There are many other ways this might play out..!",No Opinion,14.85

10 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Imminent Bid - Thread Removed,"@Z - the answer is that a sale of part (or all) of GGPâs interest in Hav might or might not require shareholder consent, depending on the size/materiality of the proposed transaction assessed using something called the âclass testsâ. The class tests examine a proposed transaction using 5 measures: Gross Assets, Profits, Turnover, Consideration & Gross Capital.  Each measure utilises a specified numerator and denominator to derive a percentage indicating the materiality of the proposed transaction. Timing also matters; if such an asset disposal were structured in tranches over time there are provisions that require the aggregation of transactions in the preceding twelve months. A âsubstantial transactionâ is one which exceeds 10% in any of the class tests. It triggers a shareholder notification. Only a disposal exceeding 75% (thus considered a ""fundamental change of business"") in any of the class tests would require shareholder consent (50% of those voting, tbc*), via a GM. So the correct answer is that it depends upon the %, the price, the timing and upon how the class tests are applied. It is not straightforward! Based on todayâs figures, an asset disposal (of whatever %) at <Â£475m *could* be below the 75% level on all of the class tests, and thus subject to shareholder notification only.",No Opinion,14.85

Of course if I hear, I'll post a reply here :-)As investors we have to exercise a 360 focus and speculate on any and all outcomes and then prescribe our own probability to it  - and also a strategy if for instance itâs GGP selling itâs entire stake in Havieron, I have to think about what will I do then etc.? The Flow Chart approach as such and in some cases, weâre more passengers to fate unfortunately.NCM either bidding for our entire stake in Havieron or the entire company are feasible scenarios (in that they canât be regarded as completely impossible) but we all have our own opinions on IF they will happen, WHEN they might happen and at WHAT price etc.The IF, WHAT & WHEN is fine to discuss IMO, what these platforms are for, I didnât see NCM triggering the 5% option this soon but I never discounted it as a potential scenario, just because I donât want something to happen doesnât make it less feasible.Some might be correct and they bid for GGP soon, or they might be wrong and NCM donât, or they just bid for Havieron or perhaps just purchase the 5% orâ¦â¦. they donât even go for that as the valuation goes against their desired outcome . Personally, I think if NCM do want all of Hav or GGP theyâll probably need a FS in hand to help justify the ROI. I hope Iâm right if they do take either route - the earlier it is - the cheaper theyâll need to pay probably.Not long till Feb when we see the updated/upgraded MRE and the 5% FMV outcome - itâs pretty exciting to me, we KNOW Havieron is special, of course itâs going to be chased after - rather be in that boat than the other 2999 explorers still looking for their Havieron :-))",No Opinion,15.1

9 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Recent transactions in the 10-20moz range - some help please…?,"@Zoros, thank you for setting out a credible scenario and a related valuation model. This is what investment is really aboutâ¦I agree with you regarding the intent of NCM, and the likelihood/timing of them moving for 100%. Also that this event will likely create the opportunity for GGP holders to exit at a premium one way or another. My investment thesis is based on a similar narrative scenario.If I have understood your thinking, you use a baseline of 10moz - equating this with an SP of 25p - and then scale up from there, 20moz = 50p etc.When sell-side analysts propose 25p this is generally intended as a âwithin 12mâ price target. The target is tied more to time than it is to events - itâs not proposed as âpost-MRE2â or âpost-DFSâ for example. Itâs certainly not tied to oz.A couple of thoughts on using it as you have:1. The start-point (10moz = 25p) may reflect more or less than you implicitly permit. It is always difficult to âproveâ what is and isnât priced in to any SP. If the start point isnât correct (in either direction) then building on it as you propose will enlarge the impact of any underlying error. And I am intrinsically wary of any methodology that starts and finishes with an SP as there is a risk that there is some circularity embedded. We are also a long way from 25p today.2. Your methodology implicitly assumes a linear relationship between discovered-oz and SP. This may not be accurate. Some would say that later (block-cave mined?) oz will generate more profit/oz, so perhaps a doubling of oz would lead to more than a doubling of SP. Or the converse, where more oz equals extended LOM but processing or similar constraints mean that annual FCF (thus âdividend powerâ) generation has no headroom.Soâ¦ I am onboard with your narrative, but a little less sanguine with regard to how your SP forecast is built.",No Opinion,15.0

9 Jan '22,RomeWasnt...,RE: After the 5% is purchased,"Hi Zoros - I just cannot see what selling just Hav does for building a multi-billion cap company. I completely get a large dividend pay out with the proceeds but then what. Then itâs going back to square one. This situation is not repeatable, Hav coupled with NCM and the infrastructure is just the perfect storm. dividend gets paid, mcap immediately drops to minimal amounts and then we hope to find something else to build again, but we wonât find another Hav. Therefore to me, selling just Hav is not a sensible option. I very much believe we will get acquired by NCM as I just canât see that when this is in production they will want to give up 25% of the income. My hope is we stay as a partner and we build a proper company through exploration and M&A, if allowed to what an unbelievable launch asset we have to achieve that. I certainly think SD is setting the business up for that, we saw last week the ex-exploration manager for sandfire resources (9.5yrs) join Ggp. Certainly bringing in some expertise thatâs for sure.

9 Jan '22,thelearner,RE: After the 5% is purchased,"I think SD wants to retain the 25% of Hav - why would you not do this unless you got a too good to refuse offer to sell, but I think SD and his team know that Hav is only going to increase in value - there is potentially much more deeper down and in the Hav blocks - and it will be several years before anyone truly knows the size. Hav will be developed by NCM in phases, and there will probably be multiple phases of underground mining - they are world experts at this - look at Cadia. Telfer is a high capacity mine - had to be as Telfer processes relatively low grade ore - so there are high volumes of feed ore for the gold and copper output. When Telfer gets the 2/3/6 MT early feed ore from Hav - it is going to be much higher grade with a very nice output. Once we start bulk mining, the volumes of feed ore will increase and grades will be lower. I think SD and team if we retain 25% of Hav will use the very nice and growing income stream to go exploring more with the drill bit. And possibly start to develop some of the other projects with partners. We have blocks around and in the same region as other discoveries - but around Hav is still relatively virgin area. Deep exploring is slow and expensive compared to shallow stuff. We just have to hope we get a hit on a 100% owned tenement - anything in Juri will also be a bonus - and there are already early indications of some Telfer like mineralisation.  Long term - this company has loads of potential IMHO, but as always with mining exploration, it's hard, and you need a bit of luck as well. But demand for copper and battery minerals will be ever increasing in future. Personally I don't think mineral prices are going to explode to many multiples of where they are now - once they become too expensive the general public cannot buy the products that they are needed for.

Presumably this would be by Newcrest.Very low cost as measured by AISCPotential (though there are other views) for growing PoG as this has historically occurred during inflationary periods.

A.n.other, miner could buy and because of the agreements I place NCM would control and process and the purchaser would get paid 25% after tolling costs.2.	NCM could buy and have 100%, 3.	An investment company interested in the long term, and no challenge to NCMOnly the third option can I see paying more than NCM.But to sell the 25% GGP would have to agree the sale, and it would most likely be a board decision not shareholders.Alternative 2, Someone might like to buy GGP, a takeover but what for?We have one real asset Havieron, Alterative 1 deals with the sale of that asset, only if the 25% was wanted for itself and GGP would not sell, would alternative 2 come into play, there would only be NCM interested, and they seem happy to (cheaply) buy in via JV, once product has been found.So why buy the Explorer part of GGP they can set up an explorer arm anytime they want but you have cost of failure and maybe success.Alternative 3Stay as we are and the cash generated by our assets allow us to be a top explorer, and hope we have success it is not guaranteed, and pay dividends.If I have missed an alternative very happy to discuss and understand.",No Opinion,15.0

8 Jan '22,Jerryspaniel,Happy new year.,"Hello everyone. I have taken a month off posting as I was grieving over the loss of my namesake and best friend. For some of you that will be a bit weird but for those who understand and took time to post messages of sympathy, many thanks. Much appreciated. I have read every message though and at times thought about saying something. Losing Jerry was quite a telling moment and put things into perspective for me (as our good friend TmT knows all too well). Sometimes less said the better. Anyhow on to more mundane things ggp related. While this may not meet with universal approval, I have greatly enjoyed reading starbrightâs posts. IMO he (I think it is a he) knows his stuff and on matters of the market workings I have found that he is explaining things perfectly. Various comments he makes are phrases and sayings that you only get from being in the market on a professional basis. Others can obviously make their own judgements, and will do, but I think he is a good un. On other matters, I am not a fan of the 5% clause, as it gives far too much power to NC to screw us, but I am relying on NC behaving responsibly, using the valmin code properly and adhering to their own ethical standards. The best deal for ggp would be $50m, to pay off the loan and a 5% NSR over greater havieron. Not going to happen sadly but anything that gives us something we can agree is âfairâ will do me. Otherwise itâs just a matter of being patient, which I am quite good at I think.

In truth they couldnât care less what the SP of a particular company is - only that their quote puts them where they need to be to compete for buys and sells without exposing themselves.The true risks of AIM for PIâs lie elsewhere - particularly around placings and other corporate actions associated with capital raising, and especially around related-party transactions.

7 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: 4pm trades ?,"@SaS - in your model, the quoted price is set only by small retail trades processed online. If the quoted price doesnât follow the reported trades you propose manipulation as the cause. I am trying to explain that what you are choosing to look at  is only part of the picture.  In reality there are other trades taking place, and other factors impacting upon the prices quoted by the MMâs. For example, there are different regulatory obligations for telephone deals than there are for online trades , so the prices you might be quoted if you ring for a quote could be different to those you see on L2, or when you try what is aptly named a âdummy tradeâRemember also that there are multiple (6 I think for GGP?) market-makers, and that the quoted spread is set by their best bids and offers. One MM moving their own marks might or not affect the quoted spread. Believe me the MMâs are in vicious competition with each other for flow, and are not arranging 6-way calls or WhatsApps to collaborate in showing prices designed to trick retail investors into selling their âgolden ticketsâ.MMâs  move prices in response to exogenous data. For example - most equity spreads were widened around the time of the US jobs report this afternoon as the risk of volatility was heightened. MMâs are also sometimes told by their internal risk teams that they have to square their positions before a certain time. You are right to observe that the trade data you can see on L2, and the prints on LSE/ADVFN etc do not always readily explain movements in the quoted spread.  You are wrong to characterise everything you canât see through this window as âmanipulationâ. There are many many reasons why quoted prices change. Itâs futile to look - as you are - at a small subset of data and try to draw universal conclusions.",No Opinion,15.0

This equates to 11p a share.And I think this is what you are steering us towards, aren't you? IE: a pitiful amount?Now working with the same 'base' figures but from a different angle perhaps:(10Moz from the MRE2 and 30% sell off) Brokers suggest GGP (HAV actually - because outside Hav, to date nothing worth its salt has been found yet, so 'nil' attached to regionals) is worth 25p per share. Let's assume the SP for GGP(hav) is @ 25p after the MRE2. This makes the mine in its entirety worth Â£3.5Bn. GGP would be worth just over a billion. NCM and GGP both know there is a LOT more there @ Hav than 10+Moz. And each time another MRE is published throughout the 4 stages of development, the resource grows and the price to  sell to NCM will grow. So it is encumbent upon GGP to keep NCM at bay for as long as possible.There will come a time however, when GGP cannot defend themselves to ever growing bids by NCM (or for that matter a.n. other), so (IMO) I would expect GGP to capitulate at or around the DFS (Q4/22). By then I would expect a conservative resource of around 20Moz give or take.[The completion of the decline will make for more and better targetted assays at depth, so the results could escalate].The leads me to infer that the SP on fundamentals alone, will be around the 40 - 50p range (Twice that at the MRE2 stage).I also expect a premium to be added to this, of around 40 to 50%. To take into account future 'finds' by NCM. Overall I would expect GGP to sell Hav for between 60 - 75p, with some confidence. To underscore my 'thinking' the following would have to happen:GGP sells the early 5% for a minimum of Â£175/oz.The MRE2 must be > 10MozAu.DFS must be this year.

7 Jan '22,Bamps21,RE: Nickel Ore,"Mining is vertical; and it is deep. Deep can sometimes be very deep. A standard mine typically extracts from between 500m and 2,000m below the surface. Anything deeper than that is reckoned deep shaft mining. The global record is held by a mine in South Africa that is extracting from around 3,500m.A common trend in underground mines is that mines are going deeper and payloads are increasing. 60t carried at 20m/s is the largest to date.Not surprisingly, therefore, mines demand big kitâlarger hoists, with specialized designsâboth for lifting equipment and of the ropes that go with them. The two are inextricably intertwined.Ropes can be quite big: 50â60mm in diameter. Lengths are very long: a lift can be 3,000m, which will need 3.5km of rope in one stretch. It is not easy to handle such a big rope. Stretch is not something that applies much in normal crane work, where ropes are 50m or 100m long, but in mining, with very very long ropes the stretch becomes important.

I am a generalist not a mining expert so am posting these figures in the hope that one (or more) of the resident mining experts can confirm or correct as appropriate. Transaction details are not published in a consistent/coherent way, so I am effectively trying to summarise them within a common framework. Plenty of scope for error, hence this request. In particular I am keen to avoid pitfalls such as Au vs AuEq, complications around secondary minerals etc.A. NCM negotiated the purchase of 70% of Red Chris in Aug â19 for USD806.5m. At that point, RC had:Reserves - None 0mozResources  - Measured + Indicated 12moz - Inferred 8mozTotal 20moz @ USD58 per âincluded ozâB. Regis negotiated the purchase of a 30% non-operating stake in Tropicana in April â21 for USD650m. At that point, Tropicana had:Reserves - Proven 0.8moz - Probable 1.9mozResources - Measured 1.2moz - Indicated 2.4moz - Inferred 3.0mozTotal 10.3moz @ USD210 per âincluded ozâC. NCM negotiated the acquisition of Pretium in Nov â21 at a price valuing 100% at USD2,800m. At that point, Pretium had:Reserves - Prov+Prob 4.3moz (incl 29.6moz Ag converted at 80:1)Resources - Meas+Ind 8.0moz (incl. 48.8moz Ag converted at 80:1) - Inferred 3.3moz (incl. 13.4moz Ag converted at 80:1)Total 15.6moz  @ USD179 per âincluded ozâ[Why is the Red Chris figure so different to the other two? I am inclined to attribute this to the fact that P&P reserves were nil at the point of negotiation. Today, RC reports 8moz as reserves and 12moz as resources. My interpretation is that NCM moved early here and will have benefitted from exploration upside in the years since the deal was done.]If I can gain some comfort over the figures above (ie correct any mistakes I may have made) I will extend/adapt this analysis to estimate an implied valuation range for the 5%.

It is commonly associated with other sulfides such as pyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite in basic igneous rock intrusions. These sulfide ore bodies are probably produced through magmatic segregation. As the hot liquid of the magma cools, crystals of high-density minerals such as metal sulfides fall to the bottom of the magma chamber and collect into one large metal-rich bonanza for mining companies.âThat sounds good",Strong Buy,14.85

7 Jan '22,StarBright,RE: Oops.  Someone just made a £2k loss...,"If âladder tradingâ was such an effective method of manipulating a share-price, it would - of corse - be commonplace. And it would work from the long-side as well as the short. But itâs not something that I have seen in my 25+ years in the fund management industry. Here are the views of some REAL shorters thoughâ¦https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-AboutâWhen GameStopâs share price began to tank following late Januaryâs heady highs, a conspiracy theory began to emerge online.  Retail investors posting on Reddit and elsewhere claimed they had been the victims of a âshort ladder attack,â in which hedge funds made a concerted effort to bid down shorts between themselves to make it appear that stock prices are plummeting. Their theory is that the appearance of falling share prices prompts actual stockholders to sell, thus driving down the actual share prices.  But hereâs the thing: short sellers have never heard of the strategy.On Tuesday, Jim Chanos, founder of Kynikos Associates, tweeted, âCan anyone explain to me what a âshort ladder attackâ is? I have seriously never heard the term before this week.â Chanos did not return an email seeking comment Wednesday.  Likewise, when Institutional Investor asked Citron Researchâs Andrew Left about the topic via email Wednesday, his response was: âDonât know what a short ladder attack is?â After receiving an explanation on the subject, he called the theory âstupid.â   According to one Redditor, a short ladder attack goes like this: a neighbor plans to sell his car. You want to buy it, but at a lower price. They start loudly making fake offers on other cars that donât exist in earshot of the neighbor who actually wants to sell his vehicle.  This way, by the time you approach the guy selling the car, he believes itâs worth less than he initially thought. âHe heard the other sales numbers and thinks, âMaybe this isnât worth what I thought it was.â And boom! You convinced that dumb neighbor his tendies were stale.â Tendies, in WallStreetBets parlance, are gains or profits made on a stock. According to Muddy Waters founder and chief investment officer Carson Block, the theory is bunk. âThe concept of a âshort ladder attackâ is just another iteration of the false conspiracy theories about how the few billions of dollars of capital focused on short selling somehow controls markets containing trillions of dollars of capital focused on long buying,â he said via email Wednesday. âPut it up there with California wildfires are started by space lasers.ââ",No Opinion,14.85

To buy the complete company needs shareholder approval and from reading here I think at least 75p.The only way to find out is for the suitor to make the offer for GGP, but I for one do not think it will happen. My reasoning is we are still explorers and we own a minority share in a mine, what I hope will be a great success.The next question is can NCM buy the other 25%, and this I think is worrying as I am not sure that the board could sell the other 25% without shareholder approval.  It would if it happened mean a special dividend of most of the money received, no investor would hold a loss even the one that purchased @38.5 a year ago and then steered clear on both selling and buying more.This leaves GGP a very well financed explorer with several good prospects.  I have not seen the prospect set out on here before and it is only my thoughts of a way this could go.If this became reality then with NCM as a partner (or others) we could when we find other prospects end up repeating the process with JURI and others.

Gold prices fell below the key physiological level of $1,800/oz and silver was below $23/oz. Although it is expected that platinum prices will increase in the long-term, the commodity recorded an over 8% loss last year due to lower demand amid the current shortage of semiconductor chips.âPrice around $966 per Troy ounce down from $1259 in May looks like due for a bounce.Could there be PGMs at Havieron well yes a possibility a 50-50 chance maybe in the nickel sulphides.Nickel sulphides would theoretically be coming from the same fault as the Dyke is following.Sciencedirect are suggesting they appear on the footwall side of a fault or on the west side of our Dyke, I donât know if thatâs the case here but could be the reason for the depth you mentioned.From the fault line may indicate sulphides intrusions further north as well maybe Havieron North and Atlas , only drilling will inform us of this.A sulphide ore has a chemical formula (Ni,Fe)9S8Thatâs 50%Ni/Fe and 50% sulphide In amongst the Ni,Fe can be small amounts of cobalt, following my posts when I first started mentioning cobalt prices were at c$27,000 per ton today itâs $70,500 a steady incremental rise not like nickel which is very variable depending on how the Russians can export it. They did flood the market in the 1990s.This is a link on experiments at Radio Hill on nickel extraction https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/pentlanditeI can see more minerals being mined at Havieron than just the gold and copper but all depends how NCM want to play it and if theyâre in economic quantities ",Strong Buy,15.6
6 Jan '22,SpadesAspade,Eric The Eagle,"On a recent trip to the United States , Tony Blair, Ex. Prime Minister of the UK and now U.N. Middle East Peace Envoy, addressed a major gathering of Native American Indians. He spoke for almost two hours on his success in bringing about a lasting peace settlement amongst the warring nations of the Middle East, likening it to the way that the U.S. Government found a suitable agreement with the  North American tribes. At the conclusion of his speech, the elders presented him with a plaque inscribed with his new Indian name - Walking Eagle. A very chuffed Tony then departed in his motorcade, waving to the crowds.. A news reporter later asked one of the Indians how they came to select the new name given to Tony Blair.  They explained that Walking Eagle is the name given to a bird so full of **** that it can no longer fly. I think we have a flock of these types on here. Donât you ?",No Opinion,15.6

5 Jan '22,Dip666,RE: Valmin Valuation  Example,"	â¢	Exploration Targets were defined to demonstrate upside potential of the Kharmagtai Project, incorporating areas which could potentially be added to the resource inventory in the near to mid-term. 	â¢	Two types of Exploration Target have been defined:	?	Exploration Targets defined on the basis of drill hole results, as well as extensions of a 2018 Mineral Resource estimate.	?	Exploration Targets where corroborating ****geophysical and geological data highlight potential extensions to identified mineralisation and hence are potentially more conceptual.	â¢	SRK has assumed that a reasonable buyer would take these exploration targets into consideration when purchasing the relevant assets, but would assign the majority of value to the stated Mineral Resources.	1)	Comparative Transaction: In SRKâs opinion, the transactions considered most comparable to the Kharmagtai Project are two Oyuut Ulaan (Red Mountain) transactions.	2)	Usual Yardstick Ranges: 	?	Measured = 2% to 5% of Spot Price	?	Indicated = 1% to 2% of Spot Price	?	Inferred = 0.5% to 1% of Spot Price	?	Target = 0.1% to 0.5% of Spot Price	3)	`Peer Analysis: Reviewed the Enterprise Value (EV) of selected listed companies (ASX, AIM, OTC and TSX-V) with defined resources as reported by S&P Global Market Intelligence.	4)	Geo-scientific approach : As an order of magnitude check, SRK has also valued the Kharmagtai Project exploration tenure using a geo-scientific method. SRK notes that the base acquisition cost (BAC) for an average mining licence in Mongolia can be calculated using only the rental costs plus reasonable administration costs, as there are no minimum expenditure requirements.	5)	Rule of Thumb : This means allocating a dollar value to each resource tonne in the ground based on recent transaction data with secondary support as implied by standard industry yardsticks. Where appropriate, discounts are applied to the estimated contained mineralisation to reflect SRKâs opinion of the uncertainty in the estimates. End",No Opinion,15.675

5 Jan '22,Dip666,RE: Valmin Valuation  Example,"Synopsis of the Summary:	â¢	SRK has relied upon the Comparative Transaction(1) methodology to derive its selected value range for the stated Mineral Resources, Exploration Targets and the exploration tenure. 	â¢	Secondary support for the derived values is mostly carried out using the Yardstick(2) and Peer Analysis(3) methods but a Geo-scientific (4)Approach was also used for exploration targets that is Cost-based which also allows for Exploration Targets..	â¢	Most methods were Market-based Approaches from the Valmin Code as oppose to Income-based or Cost-based, Market-based is the only approach that includes: Exploration, Pre-Development, Development and Production categorised projects.	â¢	SRK has chosen to position its preferred value for exploration targets above the mid-point in recognition of the fact that the exploration potential is associated with a granted mining licence, enabling the rapid progression towards mining should appropriate technical studies prove positive. 	â¢	When only a Mineral Resource has been outlined and its economic viability remains to be established (i.e. there is no Ore Reserve), typically SRK employs aârule of thumbâ (5) approach to resource valuation.	â¢	Exploration Targets may be valued similarly to defined Mineral Resources but typically include a substantial discount to reflect the lower levels of confidence or lack of supporting data underpinning such estimates.	â¢	For poly-metallic projects containing more than one metal or commodity, such as Kharmagtai, it is common to adopt a metal transaction ratio (MTR) for valuation purposes.	?	The MTR is the ratio of the transaction value (as implied by transactions involving comparable projects) to the gross dollar metal content (as implied by the contained metal held in Mineral Resources for the comparable project), expressed as a percentage.	?	The MTR enables direct comparison of projects based on metal content and is used for valuation purposes only. It does not consider ultimate metal recoverability as required by JORC Code (2012) and hence caution should be used when assessing metal content for any other purpose.	â¢	To value Xanaduâs Mineral Resources/ Exploration Potential at Kharmagtai, SRK has carried out a search for publicly available information on market transactions involving similar assets that have occurred in the period leading up to, or about, the Effective Date of this valuation.

5 Jan '22,speedymeadie,RE: GGP and 2022,Hi Zoros/Starbright. Your debate on geopolitical events affecting the equities markets is a very valid point. In times of trouble real assets shine and most will run to cash. The problem with this is we are in a high inflation cycle and tackling this cycle is very difficult due to high debt levels and CBs being unable to raise interest rates by a significant amount. PMs will be the place to shelter funds and what better place is there than a world beating gold mine. I see no threat of a correction in the GGP SP other than up. ATB Speedy,No Opinion,15.0

I think it's fair and honest that we hear both sides to the ""shorting"" saga. We can then decide for ourselves.I picked up on a poster called: ""bluetigeruk"" early last December. I asked the Q: why does 'Ortex' show shorting @ GGP?He replied:Zoros - this is from Ortex own web site: ""...There have also been suggestions that stock lending data is less useful or less relevant due to synthetic activity surrounding a stock. You can create similar economic effects using derivatives or âsyntheticâ structures without ever owning the underlying security â options and futures being obvious examples. However, remember that almost all meaningful synthetic positions will be hedged by the underlying issuer. For example, if a significantly large put option is created, the issuer will likely hedge that position by borrowing and shorting the stock. ORTEX stock lending and short interest data therefore also include data related to synthetic positions.Here a counterparty creates a synthetic PUT - they issue the PUT and then hedge it by stock borrowing - ORTEX also says they take a short position - but thats not true - Ortex are selling you a product here.-----AIM MM dont run aggressive books - they are not allowed to - they have a Risk Manager who sets their limits and reviews regularly (BARINGS etc) most of their trades will be automated trades from you and me thinking our Â£20k trade is a monster - its not of course. An AIM MM will be given say Â£50k either way as a limit and if they go over that they have to square the book off - this means get the exposure back into the limits - thats why prices move - a MM sells Â£100k of shares to Zoros and needs to cover that quickly - MM will charge you a spread premium for a trade that size and then will quickly whizz around the other MM and Dealers to cover inside the price. MM dont make their money by risking their capital - they make it by buying at one price and selling at another - they want to make 1p on 100,000 shares in 3 minutes - not Â£12p a share over the next 18 months. They don't have the capital to do this. I worked as a dealer for a few years in the City so i understand how the market works between broker and MM. Anyway - AIM stocks are way too illiquid for most professionals - the door closes to almost nothing once the market gets fast - thats why Directors are advised to dribble out regular share sales every month on share options etc....""

Now unless we have an expert who is closer to the hub than our brokers, I have chosen to run with 25p after the MRE2 results are advertised. Not much, some of you ask? We have another 5 or 6 MRE's to go remember before production......slowly slowly catcha monkey!So: Another 10Moz to add to our existing 4 ish Moz...for 25p. If it's more then I will be over the moon.Until now I have been a strong supporter of the 15p SP, based on what we have to date. I will now expect and support 25p for the foreseeable future (ie: next MRE/sale of 5%/FS/bid).Any of the previously mentioned catalysts could lift the SP above this, remember.In closing - DYOR and base the next several months on what you expect the SP to be.  25p is mine.This now leads nicely onto the 5% valuation...........Z ",No Opinion,14.85

I got them in about 2 Â½ years ago when they drilled their big discovery drill hole #5 of 250 meters grading 5 grams per ton gold. This is one of the top new discoveries of the last 10 years. JV partner â Newcrest Mining, just announced a maiden resource of 4.2 million ounces of gold equivalent. The deposit is wide open so as Newcrest continues to drill it while they soon start driving an underground decline, I am certain the deposit will get a lot bigger. Newcrest should take them over but if Newcrest feels the takeover would be to expensive, the worst case scenario is that Newcrest starts mining this very profitable deposit and doesnât takeover GGP, then Newcrest will have to share 25% of the profit from the mining operation meaning GGP turns into a very profitable miner and would be re-rated accordingly. Be patient. *** just announced yesterday*** Newcrest is about to buy an extra 5% of the Havieron project for fair market value. A takeover might be looming after this deal.",Strong Buy,14.75

From my understanding it is this growing pressure during bull runs from shareholders to see proof of longevity and growth that helps push M&A valuations too for targeted projects and companies.The planned sustainability report, perhaps delay in MRE 2 due in a desire to flesh out on top of lab delays of course, Newcrest moving rapidly to try to increase their stake in Havieron at this early juncture within the 12 month option period, signs from the mine plan/decline as being translated for us by our board experts, known scope for production increase in FS,  potential success at other targets within the mining lease are all very encouraging signs to focus on versus worrying about the share price all day IMO.I agree with Paddy that the FS would probably need to be in place to help Sandeep to push through any potential plan for a full offer for Havieron with his own board, still can't help feeling that potential from the Eastern Breccia and Zipa/Hav North has brought some urgency from Newcrest, fingers crossed we get those lab results in the next results evening :-))",No Opinion,15.1

Financing costs and and the time value of money (not all of the gold will be mined on day 1!) also act to reduce the value that shareholders can realise from gold in the ground, but they are topics for another day as they are far harder to estimate.The various broker SP estimates (Hannam etc) always appear low compared to valuations discussed on this board precisely because they incorporate the impacts of taxes, financing costs and the time value of money.I hope this makes sense.",No Opinion,15.1

4 Jan '22,lebugue-addick,RE: What detemines how much Newcrest will pay?,"Redtrader @10.32 - you could also have mentioned the significant copper resource which will need to be taken into account for determining the 5%FMV. There are so many quotable extracts from Sandeep that SD can use in any negotiations. That's why I think we will reach an amicable settlement. If not, the independent assessor will be pointed in the right direction. The considerable haste of Newcrest is a strong indicator that they will play fair as they had until December to reach a settlement. The assessor, if needed, is bound to ask ""why now?"" and draw his own conclusion that there is more resource that needs to be brought in to another upgraded MRE.This is an extract from Sandeep in the Newcrest annual report:""We expect that the contribution of copper will continue to increase, with the relative proportion of copper to Cadiaâs revenue expected to increase over the coming years in line with the estimated grade profile of gold and copper. Wealso have significant copper potential at Red Chris, Havieron, Wafi-Golpu and Namosi.

4 Jan '22,Canary3,Multi billion dollar deal.,"This is an important deal for NCM as well as GGP, currently they are ploughing hundreds of millions into Telfer to keep it open and expending millions on Hav,  with only a PFS to justify both spends.   By any measure Telfer is a liability to NCM until Hav produces  or is shown to have a significant value. One value that NCM can show is the cash worth of Hav as agreed with GGP,  that value will need to be considered realistic  by analysts,  the value will be the agreed amount for the 5%  times 14 for NCM and times 6 for GGP, because of course NCM pay the 5% of the value agreed to GGP.In order for that value to a 'legitimate â number, the process that is used to agree it will need to be transparent and the numbers attached to it  will need to be  validated by well crafted and  robust underpinning assumptions Those assumptions will be examined very closely by the investing community as well as potential predators. Both GGP and NCM, will IMO , have engaged specialists to assist in this process , including Lawyers  accountants and mining consultancies, all will be involved in  preparing documents to inform the process and explain the assumptions. I would imagine the fees from both GGP and NCM together will be in  7 figures.Once a deal is getting close,( lots of items will be agreed as the process continues) the lawyers will take plenty of time to draw up the final contract and the the final negotiations will take place, and then a deal is agreed.  I expect the deadline to be extended more that once, unless NCM told GGP unofficially  to start getting ready for the negotiations  some time ago, these things take a lot of time and effort and a deal worth billions of dollars ,that is vital to both parties future, will be scrutinised and discussed in great detail.If the deal is rushed and ill thought through the management of both companies will be permanently damaged, so i am expecting great things as both Sandeep and SD are not fools. Finally if the deal is as well crafted, valued appropriately, stands up to scrutiny  and shows that Hav is considerably more than a 12 year project the then Telfer moves to being an asset to NCM then IMO their SP should respond positively, and hopefully GGP will as well.All IMO of course.",No Opinion,15.15

4 Jan '22,Redtrader,What detemines how much Newcrest will pay?,"The price per ounce we are seeing seems to be based on the price Newcrest, or any other miner, pays for a mine divided by the indicated/inferred resource. This is not what is happening. They are paying for what they believe is the total economically extractable amount of ore minus the cost of extraction.  Do people really believe they will pay $700 an once with an ASIC of $700. Thats $1400 per ounce giving a profit of $400. The amount per ounce is more like $200 an ounce, even less.  It is based on how much gold they estmate can be mined. So how much gold is their in the tenenement area. The indicated/Inferred give us a high level of confidence of the minimum we have. The other drillings show us the potential. We are 1.4Km down and the ore body is still open with volume expanding. Volume is to the power of 3. With 3 tons of ore per cubic meter, a 10m cube is 3000 tons, 20m cube is 24000 tons, 30m cube is 81000 tons.  Add the fact we are seeing simillar geology at Artemis and the activity at Zipa we could have a channel from Artemis to Havieron. That is over 1 km distance . What is found at Zipa, Mica and North havieron will be added to the estmate for the potential amount of gold that can be mined at Havieron. It is the potential amount of gold that Newcrest believe exists that determines the price they will pay. It explains why the plus and minus 10% is needed. A Slight difference in the gr/T between Newcrest and GGP estimates can be a big difference in the final price of the mine.   A lot of that will be determined by experience and knowledge of other mines. It pays to have people on your side whose opinion is repected.

Newcrest Pretium acquisition. 09.11.2021 Newcrest are spending $2.80bn US for 95%, so the 100 is valued about $2.95bn US. Brucejack has an AISC $743 and is forecast to produce 311k oz pa over 13 years, which is a total of 4,043,000oz Au. The deal values each oz Au @ $730. Havieron PFS suggests the AISC will be $743 and the area in the PFS will produce 160k oz pa over 9 years, which gives a total of 1,440,000oz Au. If we use the $730 oz Au figure on Hav that values Hav at $0.25 or Â£0.18, or Â£0.054 for GGP's share. However, we know that we have 4.2m oz Au eq in the MRE. Applying the $730 oz Au figure to that values Hav at Â£0.55, or Â£0.165 for GGP's share. Double the MRE, which doesn't seem unreasonable, and you get Â£0.33. That is Â£0.039 per m oz Au eq. Regis / Tropicana came out about Â£0.044 per m oz Au. Multiply the average (Â£0.042) by 4.2m oz Au and we get Â£0.176. 10m oz Au eq would mean Â£0.42 and so-on. You can do the maths. Obviously the Brucejack mine is up and running while Havieron isn't yet, but there is obviously a lot of room for our SP to climb. It may take a while, but it will definitely happen. You only need to look at the satellite to see that.

Luckily a specialist at the hospital was at the function and he immediately realised that it was an AAA and he got Terry to the hospital and into the operating theatre in just a few minutes.  Terry recovered and invited men to a talk in which he encouraged everyone to be checked for AAA, and he said that medical advice was that if the aorta was not bulging when you were 65 it would never bulge.  I then attended a clinic for an ultrasound check which only took a few minutes, and the nurse confirmed there and then that my aorta was not bulging and I need not concern myself with the possibility of suffering from an AAA in the future.I recommend that all men over 65 should arrange for a free ultrasound check.",No Opinion,15.4

31 Dec '21,hydrogen,RE: Berenberg Note  NCM TO Buy GGP or not...?,"Hi NoTrader,You are correct - it is an old note dated 12 October 2020 (from initiation of Berenberg coverage). As a genuine investor/holder I like to look both back and forward at the data points/broker notes we have.... It's always interesting, seeing the proposition unfold, as they saw it then v now... and how far and fast we've come.  I don't think we knew anything of the new Eastern Breccia at that point, nor the new northern corridor. Nor anything 'official' about Targets outside the main oval zone other than Callum's hints... We just knew about the main pipe and that Van Eck were buying shed loads of us. Load of tosh and trash talk last night from Biggles (naturally smashed into touch again). Very interesting the Edison document Biggles relies on. As in 2018 it values Australian gold in the ground at a full DOUBLE the value of Canadian gold in the ground.  I think the valuation metric they used was  simply based on Mcap to reserves ratio.  And thus negates the premium cost of actually acquiring the gold.. Something  always goes up in value  if someone wants to buy it....But nevertheless : NCM just Paid over $600/oz for Brucejack SO Will NCM be paying $1334 per oz for the 5% of Nav  ... ? I doubt that...But Regis did just pay $850/oz for Tropicana https://www.australianmining.com.au/news/regis-receives-final-approval-for-tropicana-acquisition/Canada's Agnico Eagle Mines Paid $550/oz for Kirkland lakehttps://www.reuters.com/business/energy/canadas-agnico-eagle-buy-kirkland-lake-gold-near-11-bln-stock-deal-2021-09-28/There's a LOT in our favour right now, in term of REAL WORLD valuations in very recent transaction examples   It makes it all rather easy to dismiss Biggles and his entirely disingenuous posts.. And his throughly incorrect 4-5 years outdated $93 or 97 /oz valuation for gold in the ground (from 5 years ago when miners were at 10 year nadir lows in valuation).

The screen gave the result straight away and was under the 3cm, so all fine for me. The supporting pamphlet and the staff went through it all in a way I could understand, very caring. The basic ranges were as follows; 3cm to 4.4cm (Small size) - scans every 12 months to see if getting bigger. 4.5cm to 5.4cm (Medium size) scans every 3 months to check on size. 5.5cm or bigger (Large size) only about 1 in 1,000 have this size - referred to a specialist team usually within a few weeks to discuss possible treatment, usually an operation for about 41 in 10,000 cases. They told me if this was my result the treatment was very successful, which took away a lot of the fear, for me. I totally understand how you feel about this. However, I always felt cared for and kept informed. So please try not to worry too much until you know, and have a happy and healthy New Year.

Newcrest have activated a clause in the joint venture agreement seeking to buy a further 5% of the Havieron project from Greatland, which will begin to show the full potential of the project, which has been described by some as possibly the best discovery in  Australia in twenty years.Greatlands share price has been under constant attack by the potential takeover consortium, who to date have refused to reveal themselves, but sources state they were hoping to buy Greatland for a knock down price, before the true size of Havieron and other discoveries in the area are made public.Newcrests action in seeking a further 5% in February, is designed to illustrate the potential of their partner, who they have a close working relationship with.There is no  guarantee that both Newcrest and Greatland can agree a price at this juncture, although it is thought the lower figure will still be at a large premium to the current price.A scource  close to the action has stated under an agreement of anonymity, that with every drill finding gold and the boundaries and depth of Havieron, not yet being found, that it is possible  that the 5% purchase may be postponed until later in the year.

30 Dec '21,hydrogen,RE: Berenberg Note  NCM TO Buy GGP or not...?,"Cont: ?	The Tropicana mine was originally discovered by IGO and is subject to a 30:70 JV with AngloGold Ashanti, following a farm-in agreement that was signed in 2002. The mine entered production in 2013 and produced 518koz in 2019 with guidance of 450koz-500koz for FY 2020. It forms a core part of AngloGold Ashantiâs portfolio. IGO used Tropicana as the foundation to build out and now also operates the Nova polymetallic mine that entered production in 2017.?	The Gruyere mine is owned as a joint venture between Gold Fields and Gold Road, and it entered production in 2019. Its average production is 300koz from a bulk open pit. Gold Road retains a 100% interest in tenements that cover 4,500km2 of the surrounding Yamarna region that it is exploring. It plans to either provide an incremental feed for Gruyere or, if a discovery is large enough, develop a stand-alone operation.In our view, the success of both IGO and Gold Road demonstrate that a viable outcome for Greatland would be to retain a minority position in Havieron and fund its share of development expenditure.  We believe that the farm-in was a pragmatic way to advance Havieron without the need for excessive equity dilution for shareholders in Greatland. While the gold price is now near to record highs, the market for junior and non-producing gold equities remains reasonably challenging in terms of raising new equity. Far fewer specialist funds are investing in the sector compared with the previous cycle after years of relative underperformance.In addition, Havieron occurs at depths of between 400m and 1,300m. It therefore requires the drilling of deep and expensive holes that would be prohibitively expensive for a cash-constrained smaller company to fund. Deeper holes can cost up to USD400,000 to drill and so represent both a material expense and a significant risk for a junior.Finally, in terms of mine planning, Newcrest has world-leading experience of designing, developing and operating bulk underground operations. Self funding the development of an open-pit operation may have been feasible for Greatland, especially if it used contractors for mining. However, for a company of its size, the development of even an intermediate-depth underground mine would probably have been beyond its capabilities.Our expectation is for Havieron to be initially developed as a mid-scale underground operation with capex of USD250m. Given Greatlandâs current market capitalisation of GBP832m we believe that the company should be able to fund its 30% share of the project development cost either through debt or equity, or a combination of the two, especially as the design process and development risk will be principally taken by Newcrest. In addition, as the ore from Havieron will be fed into the plant at Telfer, there is a minimal risk with plant development and processing. ENDs",No Opinion,15.0
30 Dec '21,hydrogen,Berenberg Note  NCM TO Buy GGP or not...?,"Key investment point one: Newcrest is likely to seek to acquire Greatland but holding a minority position in Havieron is a viable outcome?	The farm-in agreement with Newcrest should take the Havieron project through to feasibility study. Newcrest holds a 70% interest in the project and we believe that it is ultimately likely that it will seek to acquire the company to wholly own the deposit.?	We believe that this would represent a good outcome for Greatland given the cost and technical risk of developing a large and potentially bulk scale underground mining operation.?	That said, the experiences of IGO Limited and Gold Road suggest that maintaining a minority interest in a project allows juniors to reduce the technical, financing and operating risk, and gives them a basis on which to develop a business. Remaining independent is, therefore, a viable option.Greatlandâs core asset is the Havieron project in northern Western Australia. Havieron is subject to a farm-in agreement with Newcrest that could ultimately result in the latter holding a 75% interest in the project, leaving Greatland with the balance. Newcrest will need to have spent USD65m, including USD20m on a feasibility study at the project, to have reached the 70% level of ownership, with the additional 5% potentially acquired at âfair market valueâ.Newcrest is Australiaâs largest gold mining company and a tier-one operator by global standards. It has a market capitalisation of USD19bn and produced 2.2Moz of gold in FY 2019/20 to June, at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of USD862/oz. The companyâs core assets are Cadia in New South Wales, Lihir in Papua New Guinea and Telfer in Western Australia. Newcrestâs core portfolio is mature and the company has been active from an M&A perspective. It acquired the Red Chris mine in Canada in 2019 and has also built a 32% interest in the Fruta del Norte mine in Ecuador, which is in the process of ramping up.In our view, it is highly likely that Newcrest will ultimately elect to purchase Greatland in its entirety once the feasibility study has been completed as the exploration potential of the broader Paterson area, in conjunction with Havieron itself, could underpin the long-term future of Telfer. From an early stage of the farm-in agreement, Newcrest has shown a high level of commitment to the project. Its exploration spending has increased at a faster rate than envisaged in the farm-in agreement.That said, there have been a number other similar projects, most notably Gruyere and Tropicana, where the major has elected not to acquire the junior partner.?

30 Dec '21,hydrogen,Golden fireball Asteroid heading to ggp holders back pockets...,"Letâs be 100% clearâ¦.The market cannot value Havieron. Only GGP/NCM can value this ore body.  Becauseâ¦ We donât have all of the relevant information. So, thus, whatever value the market presently puts on the âknown elementsâ of Havieron it will be significantly lower than the actual value of the âknown knownsâ plus the âknown unknownsâ.  Biggles knows this. But it appears some are trying their best to mess with peoples heads and sow FUD. These people are just traders or motivated to create sellers. And thus perhaps dislodge any uncertain holders, who frankly have no idea how to value an ore body like Havieron.  ($300-400/oz btw) As has been repeatedly stated now, by the company  in various emails published here, and also by the recent broker notes; any valuation will need to capture the value of the whole Havieron orebody and not just that small portion of it that is hosted within the initial pre-feasibility study (PFS) reserve that was focused on the South East Crescent Zone of the resource. Havieron has now had more than 200,000m of drilling completed and the orebody remains open at depth and with multiple mineralised bodies that have yet to be incorporated into the resource. Berenberg currently attributed a value of USD228m to the additional 5% share in Havieron; GBp4.3/share.That values the company at roughly $1.36bn on HAV alone.  Or just over Â£1bn And for the avoidance of doubt, that $228m valuation must exclude any potential from Zipa / Hav mor â¦. (as this is not confirmed to Berenberg yet) Further, the rest of the portfolio has to be worth around $50m (especially with the increasing chances of a 2nd discovery and/or bleed from Havieron related intrusives into 100% owned ground like  Swag, which canât be far off now given what just came out of Apollo.Once we get our 5% cash share, we can drill whatever  we want in the portfolio quickly and retain  a huge cash balance : for possible acquisitions and or further development of Havieron (albeit it makes sense to debt fund the remaining $70m capex as that will make us less of a target as a whole)  We are obviously a possible target going forward and this will underpin our valuation at Â£1bn level.

30 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: What’s in it for Shaun ?,"@SaS asked ââ¦what happens if an offer came in just for the asset ? Does anyone know the answer to that ?âThe answer is that a sale of part (or all) of GGPâs interest in Hav might or might not require shareholder consent, depending on the size/materiality of the proposed transaction assessed using something called the âclass testsâ. The class tests examine a proposed transaction using 5 measures: Gross Assets, Profits, Turnover, Consideration & Gross Capital.  Each measure utilises a specified numerator and denominator to derive a percentage indicating the materiality of the proposed transaction. A âsubstantial transactionâ is one which exceeds 10% in any of the class tests; it triggers a shareholder notification. Only a disposal exceeding 75% in any of the class tests would require shareholder consent (50% of those voting, tbc*), via a GM.  Based on todayâs figures, an asset disposal at <Â£475m *could* be below the 75% level on all of the class tests. As always - I am happy to answer questions on this.To consider the wider question of âWhatâs in it for Shaun Day?â it is important to understand the qualities needed to gain a position as CEO of a FTSE250 market-cap company. These roles are highly sought after, and rarely go to anyone who is not highly professional and intrinsically motivated. Shaun Day will be driven to do the best for his shareholders, because he will know that his professional peers are watching. That - rather than daft ideas about Â£Â£Â£ and a soft role with NCM - will be what drives him on every day. High profile roles are subject to constant peer scrutiny, and Shaun is early enough into his career that he will want to be seen to do the best job possible for GGPâs shareholders. After all this is his first CEO role. GGP is about as far from a lifestyle company with soft director roles as you can get. I think it is specious to consider that he will be swayed by personal considerations in the manner proposed. Having seen him in action (in interviews and the AGM etc) I am 100% confident that heâs a pro and will play GGPâs cards as well as he can.",No Opinion,15.0

30 Dec '21,SpadesAspade,What’s in it for Shaun ?,"I keep asking myself, Whatâs in it for Shaun Day to sell us down the river for a much undervalued price that some of you guys on here keep repeating. As far as I can see, nothing. Itâs not as if he has millions of shares to fall back on is it. He only has options at 25p to purchase five million, so even if he sold us Lock Stock & Barrel for say a quid a share, that would probably only just be enough for him to scrape by on. So imo that ainât happening anytime soon. Now looking at the 5% FMV, again why would he even consider selling that cheaply?Even if you go off Berrenbergs broker note, they are saying they are expecting a further 10M oz from outside the known resource. That then makes 14M ozâs. Now if NCM are saying there will be in excess of a $1000 per ounce profit after AISC, that figure alone would generate a profit of $14B. Now funny as it may seem 30% of that technically would be owned by GGP. Thus the profit would be a cool $4.2B ($1 per share) less of course any taxes, tolling costs etc etc. But what if they keep discovering more ounces. 20, 30, 40 million ounces. What if they find new pods at the Eastern corridor, Havieron North, Zipa etc. Why the hell do some here say stupid statements like â100 - 250 million dollars is FMVâ for what we have. The trouble is we donât know what we have yet. There is no way that the two companies are going to be anywhere near 10% of each other, and if they are then I think the BODâs would need their heads examining.Now I know the question got answered regarding would shareholders have a say if an offer was to be made for the company, but what happens if an offer came in just for the asset ? Does anyone know the answer to that ?In the broker notes why do they always refer to a % risk factor. Is this just in case a decision to mine never comes. I can understand that, but once it does come does that risk factor element of valuation get removed.

And they won't know that until they start the process.If you read the Valmin code and the other docs, you'll see there are a variety of valuation methods, very hard to predict exactly what method/s an assessor picks and what they will include exactly when it comes to include exploration and potential using unofficial information not included in PFS/Resource estimates.Process:1) Newcrest want to agree the option exercise price by mid feb 2022,2) If Newcrest/GGP do not mutually agree on a Fair Market Value by this date then both parties put forward their own valuations3) If both valuations are within 10% of each other, then the average will be considered the valuation for Newcrest to exercise their 5% option.4) If there is a greater than 10% disparity, an independent expert is brought in to choose which one of the estimates is fair market value, so I assume that is the price that needs to be paid by Newcrest.5) Newcrest then has 30 business days to exercise its option to acquire the additional 5%.6) Should they choose to go ahead, then proceeds from the exercise will be used to repay the outstanding balance of the existing loan we have from Newcrest.Docs:https://www.valmin.org/https://download.asic.gov.au/media/5827832/rg111-published-22-october-2020.pdfhttps://download.asic.gov.au/media/1240943/rg170-010411.pdfhttps://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/takeovers/forward-looking-statements/mining-and-resources-forward-looking-statements/",No Opinion,15.3

29 Dec '21,Bamps21,What a year,"Well itâs December 2022 what a year it has been, so much has happened.The Decline was finished on time and Byrnecut on new contract to excavate the Western mining front and then on to the Eastern Front and the new plan to stope the Northern corridor.A roadheader came in a few months ago and is now on its way downwards to get to 900m deep around the spiral.The waste mound now looks enormous, a stepped structure nearly ready for its covering of soil now the first Decline is complete.The evaporation ponds are 50% complete.The Evasee fan is in position and should be working soon.The haulage road to Telfer is well under way and nearing completion.The exploration was a fantastic success with the planned 90,000m completed by June on the main ore body. A lot of those assays still pending.Some rigs have remained on the main ore body infilling deep under the Northern and Eastern breccia, the rest are still exploring Zipa ,Havieron North and recently Mica.Dioritic dykes in these 3 seem to be the order of the day with some incredible results , still a long way to go on exploring these and Artemis still drilling their targets Apollo and Atlas.2023 will see the Ggp drilling campaign start next to Apollo in Scallywag to test the extent of this target.Ggp 2022 campaign has been testing all over the place at Archie, Ernest Giles , Panorama , Rudall and Canning.Blackhills Saddlereef seems to be the success on Juri at the moment with recent drilling going deeper and hitting mineralisation.Hopefully the 5% settlement will come through soon so the drilling campaign for 2023 can be stepped up a notch.Glad to see an amicable settlement.Great relief now the FS is finally been issued now waiting for the Decision to Mine which is just a formality.Plans to start extracting into 2023 by October should be a big boost in confidence with that 6m tons mining plan being put into operation.2023 Should be another great year to look forward to.",Strong Buy,15.8

27 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: To MH 01,"Can red herrings gain legsâ¦..?Let me try to clear this one up: - the document shared by @Bamps21 earlier discusses the accounting treatment of shared enterprises in the mining sector. In simple terms there is a question over the point at which a joint venture like Hav has to be âconsolidatedâ in the financial statements of its primary owner. Consolidation requires different accounting treatment so affects the way financial statements are prepared. - In NMCâs 2021FS, Hav is treated as a JV (ie not consolidated) because NMC had only a 40% interest. In their 2022FS I expect it will be consolidated because: (i)NMCâs %interest has increased beyond 50%, (ii)they have operational control of the project and (iii) a majority representation on the JV board. It is largely âtheirsâ.- These are the tests referenced in the paper @Bamps21 shared. They are applied by accountants to determine accounting treatment. There is nothing special about the 75% figure! The document is not easy for a layman (in this sense a non-accountant) to read/interpret. @Bamps21 appears to have misinterpreted an example used to illustrate the workings of the tests via an imaginary 3-way JV in which 75% represented a controlling interest. Itâs not relevant to NMC/GGP/Hav so should be disregarded.- TLDR - there is nothing âmagicâ about the 75% figure. It isnât a threshold beyond which âcontrolâ is deemed to have been gained. It wonât support a higher (or lower) valuation for the 5%. In fact it wonât be a factor in the valuation/negotiation of the 5%. Itâs just a misreading of a technical accounting documentâ¦- Happy - as always - to answer questionsâ¦",No Opinion,16.55
27 Dec '21,lebugue-addick,Valmin Code,"It's worth writing down the nature, context and purpose of the Code before getting stuck into the detail:1.1. PurposeThe purpose of the Australasian Code for the Public Reporting of Technical Assessments and Valuations of Mineral Assets (VALMIN Code) is to provide a set of fundamental principles, minimum requirements and supporting recommendations to assist in the preparation of relevant Public Reports on Mineral Assets. The VALMIN Code is based on international good practice as currently employed in the Mineral industry, but allows for professional judgement in certain instances. The resulting Public Reports MUST (ie not advisory; emphasis important) be reliable and should be clear, concise, effective and include all the Material information required by investors and their advisers when making investment decisions. Subject to provisions in paragraph 1.3, AIG and AusIMM Members MUST adhere to the VALMIN Code regardless of where or for whom the Public Reports are prepared or the location of the Mineral Assets under consideration.1.2. ContextThe VALMIN Code is designed to fit within the Australian regulatory framework comprising the Corporations Act, and various ASIC Regulatory Guidelines and ASX Listing Rules. It is a companion to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Code). Any references to the JORC Code relate to the 2012 edition or the most recent subsequent edition.*******************The reference to investors in the Code is interesting.

Pushing forwards into later on in the year..We have a sustainability report, this maybe not much influence with private investors but will impress institutional investors. The feasibility study, which Iâm hoping will again have an upgraded resource and an updated rate of production, 50% increase in tonnage to telfer should have a large impact in my opinion and better economics (not that it could be much better!). We also have the decision to mine, I believe both Sandeep and Shaun have quoted it being the worse kept secret in the industry that Haverion is being mined in double quick time, this is just a box ticking exercise and although I donât think this will have much of an impact from  PIâs but I firmly believe this will open the floodgates to more risk adverse institutional investors and the larger money.

Itâs not a magic number as you propose and what is outlined in sections 6&7 will not  impact upon the valuation/negotiation for the 5% in any way.It relates only to how the proper accounting treatment of the Hav project within NCMâs statutory accounts is determined. It is part of determining when the Hav project has to be fully consolidated within NCMâs financial statements vs being treated as a JV. The move from 40% and the terms of the JV agreement will be the primary considerations, so I expect to see consolidation from the 2022 FS onwards.

But how about BT no 34 in the Ftse 100. two holdings notifications this year from Altice0-12% on the 10th of june, 12-18% of the 14th of DecemberShare price on the 10th of june  191.  Share price on the 24th oct 139  Closed on the 24th dec 170. So 6% of the 34th biggest company on the LSE was bought whilst the shareprice declined just under  30% until a recovery to the end of the year. With no reporting just the two holdings notifications for 18%Bt M Cap is 16 Billion so about 3 billion pounds worth of shares accumulated.The BT share price follows a very similar pattern to what we  have seen in GGP, i see that Star thinks this type of manipulation  for a750 million company like GGP is Frankly ridiculous, tell that to BT shareholders they KNOW  it's been happening.2.

24 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: SHORTS CLOSING OUT,"#2/2Way too much time and energy has been devoted on this board to poorly evidenced conspiracy theories, the only exogenous data-point for which is the Ortex stock on loan figure! The rest of the Jengaâtower that has been built - NCM/whoever looking to drive the price down, paid gangs of shorter trolls posting in collusion with the owners of the LSE bulletin boards, desperate shorters losing control, corrupt but colluding market-makers, trades âfired-inâ in response to posts here etc - has made for entertaining reading at times. But it is no more than uneducated speculation, and should be dismissed by serious investors. It is also likely to be very off-putting to any potential new investors looking here for information.There are no disclosed short positions, and the Ortex stock-on-loan figures cannot be treated as a simple proxy for short positions below the disclosure limit. The âladderingâ idea referenced frequently here isnât remotely credible as a driver of long-term price action (not enough capital deployed, spreads/costs prohibitive, risk asymmetry etc etc etc). No-one with professional experience in capital markets would take seriously the idea that the share price of a company with a FTSE250-sized market-cap might be âcontrolledâ for a year with <0.1% of its equity. It is - frankly - a ridiculous notion.The largest driver of volume and price-action (over 5.5bn shares traded this year, more than there are in issue!) will have been the group holding the largest percentage of the shares - PIâs. Realised volume and price-action data tells us that it is their selling into weakness - and the corresponding absence of new buyers deterred by the sliding SP - that has driven the price down to a level where a few institutions were tempted to nibble in the recent placing. GGP has produced a fantastic stream of drilling results and commercial progress through 2021, and its market-cap makes far more sense in objective terms at this level. If good drilling results continue (and the company plays its hand well in negotiation with its JV partner) then it can continue to grow its market-cap/SP from here. I agree with those suggesting that NCM will want 100% of Hav, and that this is likely to play out during 2022.

24 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: SHORTS CLOSING OUT,"#1/2@Jambo813 - thank you for your efforts to bring some more knowledge to bear on this topic. One small clarification if I may; the CREST requirement you mention doesnât prevent HNWIâs from shorting shares. Many full-service brokers offer access via their own CREST interface as a service to their HNWI (in fact to anyone with enough cash to open a fully-featured accountâ¦) clients. If you have such an account your broker will have  - typically available on request - a list of borrowable shares together with their associated lending costs. Subject to your collateral position you can borrow shares on this list and sell them to open a short position. Itâs an everyday occurrence. The steady decline in GGPâs share price has likely made it a tempting target for opportunistic shorters, and I suspect that there are some HNWI spivs with IBKR accounts etc whoâve viewed it as an easy train to ride. If so theyâve made out like bandits as the end-2020 SP bubble has deflated.  There is however no hard evidence to suggest their motivation has been anything beyond the stream of profits theyâve realised as the price has declined. Notably, no new TR1 holders have surfaced. As Iâve said before I think this trade is no more than picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, and they may well have given back some of their profits following the two recent RNS. I also suspect those RNS caught the MMâs on the hop with little stock on hand forcing them to raise their bids (& perhaps to borrow some shares, who knowsâ¦) as buyers for GGP made an unexpected re-appearance. Good! As you say @Jambo813, shares on loan are not always sold to create short positions. You are right that the SB companies will sometimes borrow shares for liquidity matching. Also I have tried patiently to outline the occasionally unhelpful activities of the ETF authorised participants, who can be enthusiastic borrowers. And of course shares are sometimes borrowed to regularise settlement anomalies etc.continued belowâ¦.",No Opinion,16.55

Well played Mr Day. I expected pathfinder type results but we had 8 out of 9 hit gold. This was greeted by 'shorters' or half wits as bad news but we finely had an uplift. Question,If the 38m shares on loan are not for shorting, What are they for ?So,      If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, flys like a duck,smells like a duck, and stinks to high heaven, it is probably a shorter.All in MHO.Sam",No Opinion,16.55

24 Dec '21,Jambo813,RE: SHORTS CLOSING OUT,HydroIf and I say if individuals are shorting it is likely via CFD or spreadbets and the broker writing the contract would cover the short via actual sales. Actual sales would be on a 5 to one ratio of the short. Broker makes on the different spreads between actual shares and those of the CFD/spreadbet so if the shorts get it right the broker makes even more on the eventual buy back to return loans.Not saying this is the case as the last time I looked the spreadbet company was long of shares around  56m but that was some time ago.,No Opinion,16.55

He says having someone respected like Paul Hallam on the board is a big plus too. He sent me a link to this website. https://www.valmin.org/There is a code that the independent assessor needs to abide too and therefore GGP and NCM will also have to.

24 Dec '21,Aurora1,A Logical forward view,Looking at the latest few days from a logical perspective Ive come up with (in my opinion) a few things that I think may well play out in the next few weeks/months.Starting with the massive debate of the 5% Lets start with the most conservative low ball crazy price that we should move up to in short order andI think that's whats happening and is giving some pain to a certain group of ladder monkeys.Great that Hydrogen has ousted them and powered on through a lot of flack but I think he will bat them all of.So that low ball is the ultra conservative broker price what was it about 25p. next milestone is either our next results or an MRE probably the results.Now these stellar results typically hardly move things even although we have months and months of stellar results and 1 of these rnsannouncements would be ground breaking for an explorer but we deliver one every six weeks just think about that for a minute.So this time around it might have a tad more of an impact.Next is MRE now lets just say they add 50% maybe more (we all know it eventually will be 500-1000%++ more)25p + 12.5p so now in conservative broker note world we are at 37.5p (remember that price) Now lets compare the data the brokers and we have to what the company has so Id imagine they have 6+ months more data so we need to add something for that probably takes us to aprox 50pAt this point the JV partners will be coming up with there 5% value now we need to add something for the growth thats expected with 90km drilling so thats probably another 15pso we are at 65p now and thats without another half hav near by on the block its without some more targeted 100% owned landing a greatresultso if they find nothing else which it looks like they have due to rigs so far away from Hav still working away take the 65 add on 50% premium (on a buy out) and your at 97.5p and thats no extra finds doesnt take into consideration all our other tenements.Thats my take love it or hate it but I think that is a conservative look at our value,Strong Buy,16.85

23 Dec '21,leslieby,RE: Juri JV encouragement and Merry XMAS!,"Extract: You might think an additional 585,409 shares shorted sounds like a small number of shares shorted since Herbalife has over 100 million shares outstanding. However, when you realize that there was only actually 11 trading days during that time period, and when you also understand that the shorts used computerized selling and buying of shares at opportune times to manipulate the share price, you should understand why they were able to control Herbalife's share price during that time period, to stop the upward share price momentum, and then to drive the share price slightly down.How it worksThis process can be used by hedge funds to either pump up a stock or to trash a stock but since I am using Herbalife as an example, we will discuss that situation. First information is widely distributed to make investors wonder about the company and to put fear into those longs that hold the stock. Next, high volume shorting takes place to drive the company's share price down.As the short attack continues, more people parade out news to continue to put questions in the back of investors' minds. On a daily basis, shorts use computerized trading to control the direction of the share price. At opportune times, the shorts overwhelm the buyers (bid price) of the stock by selling short large number of shares to drive the share price down and to eliminate the buyers for the stock at that given time. For people who are not familiar with the bid/ask process of trading stocks, here is a link to explain that process.........----So given the above, my query would be - as there isn't any bad news, it's all gravy atm, how do the shorts install said doubt. I'm confident that for many of us , GGP has simply cemented our views on exponential growth (?).Further and an additional interpretation from the article, if nobody sells into the 'short attack', does it not follow that they'll simply have to cover their position with ever-increasing price purchases?",No Opinion,16.85

23 Dec '21,magictrades,Juri JV encouragement and Merry XMAS!,"A lovely early Xmas present with not only the rise in SP but the Juri JV results. Encouraging early exploration works in the Paterson and Black Hills. The EM survey will help in better targeting and understanding the subsurface. I agree with the interpretation made in the announcement that they have intercepted the distal part of a potential mineralized system at Black Hills. The geochemistry of Bi-Te-Cu-Ag leans more toward a distal intrusion related deposit than any other style of mineralization and can be good pathfinders for gold. The hematite alteration is reminiscent of early drilling done by Newcrest for Havieron and the additional Pb-Zn anomalism reported is a feature that is observed in distal skarns to porphyry deposits but also veins on the margins of intrusion related gold deposits. I like how its similar in both style and composition to the Telfer reef veins. Another similarity is the reference to structure and the NW-SE orientation they allude to. I'll need to re-read some notes but Telfer has a structural component to it because it is hosted in a doubly plunging anticline and I think the veins follow the trend of what geologists call ""cleavage"" - i.e the way the rocks break. The key will be not only determining which way the veins are plunging but then testing their density. Another positive is that the mineralization is much shallower. Hematite-albite alteration at the Paterson Range East is also pretty distal. At Goliath they appears to have found more intrusive rocks than in other places. It's yet to be seen how they relate but the presence of magnetite suggests they are oxidizing. 1m @ 1.49 g.t Au is not anything to start going crazy about but shows some gold at depth and I think the plan should be to extend the hole to depth when they get to it. For now Black Hills has the better data and appears like the priority.So pretty happy. I wish everyone a good Xmas",No Opinion,16.65

I got them in about 2 Â½ years ago when they drilled their big discovery drill hole #5 of 250 meters grading 5 grams per ton gold. This is one of the top new discoveries of the last 10 years. JV partner â Newcrest Mining, just announced a maiden resource of 4.2 million ounces of gold equivalent. The deposit is wide open so as Newcrest continues to drill it while they soon start driving an underground decline, I am certain the deposit will get a lot bigger. Newcrest should take them over but if Newcrest feels the takeover would be to expensive, the worst case scenario is that Newcrest starts mining this very profitable deposit and doesnât takeover GGP, then Newcrest will have to share 25% of the profit from the mining operation meaning GGP turns into a very profitable miner and would be re-rated accordingly.

Results have been received for the remaining five holes in addition to the first four holes previously announced on 1 September 2021, along with the results of the Ground Electro-Magnetic (""GEM"") survey. Highlights Â§ All assay results have been received for the first phase of Juri JV drilling programme on the Paterson Range East and Black Hills tenements (which form the Juri JV with Newcrest)Â§ Mineralisation found at Black Hills hole BHD003:Â§ 7.9m @ 0.16g/t Au from 157m (incl. 1m @ 51ppm As)Â§ 6m @ 0.14g/t Au from 178mÂ§ 7.85m @ 0.18g/t Au from 191.15m (incl. 0.9m @ 24ppm Bi; 4.9m @ 26ppm As)Â§ 7.3m @ 0.13g/t Au from 208mÂ§ GEM survey completed identifying several promising EM conductor targets for 2022 drilling programmeÂ§ Drilling in BHD003 intersected a 60m thick anomalous zone of weak to moderate Cu - Au mineralisation, correlating with zones drilled historically by Greatland in 2019.  Anomalous   Bi-As multi element chemistry is strongly associated with the higher grade Au intersectionsÂ§ Greatland to continue in the role of Manager for the Juri JV beyond 31 December 2021 The first phase of drilling at Juri comprised nine holes for 4,958m testing six targets including five holes at the Goliath, Outamind and Los Diablos targets on the Paterson Range East licence and four holes at the Parlay, Saddle Reefs & Saddle South targets on the Black Hills licence.   Shaun Day, Chief Executive Officer of Greatland Gold plc, commented: ""We are delighted with the full set of results from the maiden drilling campaign under our Juri JV with Newcrest.  Gold mineralisation has been intercepted from eight of the nine holes tested from this campaign which is an excellent strike rate. ""These results, together with identifying several new conductor targets from the ground EM programme, increases our confidence regarding the prospectivity of the Juri JV assets and furthers our understanding of the geology of the targets on the JV ground. ""With Newcrest moving to Stage 2 funding of the Juri JV programme and Greatland continuing in the role as Manager, we are well positioned to integrate the new data into our models, refine our Juri JV targets and capitalise on this opportunity in 2022, delivering the potential to increase value for our shareholders.""

Are any in the 'NW corridor' which seems highly prospective?Others may have understood this all along, but changes my perspective if the GGP blocks are in promising areas.",No Opinion,15.7

There are many posters on this forum that would agree. :-)Sure, he was the one that described Havieron as ""an extraordinary discovery, and I say, it's a discovery in Australia for a generation, and probably a couple of generations"".IMHO, Lenigas has always liked to blow his own trumpet, and will always say what suits him as an investor, and always has. Quite why he puts those ridiculously low ball figures on Havieron is just his own view, nothing more. From what he says, anyway, in that Tweet, that price is purely a potential BID level.

Are any in the 'NW corridor' which seems highly prospective?  Others may have understood this all along, but changes my perspective if the GGP blocks are in promising areas.",No Opinion,14.9

The 5% was included in the deal for just this reason and it should put GGP in a very healthy cash positive position after deduction of costs. This gives us security and reduces further dilution risk and allows us to get on exploring other opportunities with future cash flow guaranteed. This all adds value to the company which makes us a better Institutional investment opportunity and we only lose 1/6th of our main asset.It also might provide a platform for a significant buy out of GGP as a whole, but only at a massive premium to the current SP given the future potential.

Anyone invested here over last few years, or anyone who has done sufficient research knows this. 60p for GGP or indeed just 100% of Havieron is an outright joke of a price and should be rejected out of hand.

The amount of loan drawn so far (circa$20m?) will be repaid from the proceeds (in reality GGP will not be paid that amount, it will be deducted from the 5% payment. Secondly, we will still be responsible for our, now 25%, share of development costs until Hav is in positive cashflow (2023 perhaps).Expect some more mention of this following agreed valuation, we will be saving interest costs on whatever we have borrowed, but there will likely be some form of funding agreement to cover our share of ongoing costs which will replace the loan. We may simply have a $50m (plus accrued interest) deduction from the 5% value which will represent $20m spent and $30m pre-funding of our costs.So, in short, this is a minor distraction that can be ignored for the purposes of overall valuation of HAV.

21 Dec '21,Khanzada,RE: Fair value 5%,"My view may be a tad naive, but the way I see it is this.When the JV was signed probably nobody expected us to be in the position we are in today and if it works such that NCM pay 5% of what we know of today without any provision for future growth then fair play to them, even if it rankles us.... but by the same token we wouldnt be where we are today without NCM.I think they will play fair with this 5% because I have no doubt if they are keen on taking the 5% they would quite like the other 20% too at some stage if they can. The difference being we are pretty much obligated to sell them the 5% per the terms of the JV, but not so the remaining 20%. So where our hands are tied a little here with the 5%, thats not the case with the remaining 20% and if they play hardball and force their advantage here, then they are setting themselves up for the same in return later - we could even sell to another party.In short, it makes sense to play fair.As for a potential takeover, though nothing is impossible, I think this would send out the wrong message to any future JV partners. If it were a hostile takeover I believe they need to buy 30% of the shares? Thats a lot of shares to get on the quiet and if there was a hint of them doing this im sure the SP here would rocket as they would be obliged to buy the remaining shares at the highest price paid over the previous 12 months (i think thats correct) which could make it quite costly if they get it wrong.",No Opinion,14.7

They are valuing the 12 blocks. So imagine a hit at Zipa just prior to the end of the first negotiation mid February,how does that fit in to your assumption below. You are right. Itâs totally unrealistic to expect the 5% to be valued on havarion as  âfinal fully developed valueâ thatâs just impossible!! But it would be equally naive to think we would agree not any independent agree to no subs A risk value for the future upside here discounted ofcourse. But to my mind, this is without doubt the biggest bear term catalyst for our company. The biggest test for our continued relationship with NCM too. The cards are firmly in NCMâs favour, thatâs obvious but they always have been. I fail however to see how you say the project is far from derisked? Have you followed our story? Telfer is saved. We are as derisked as it gets in mining development and exploration bar a black swan.  What is naive imvho is talk of NCM paying more for something that may not materialise?

21 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: Ducks ducks ducks,"Interesting post.It may be better to think about the price eventually achieved for the 5% as an uplift from that achieved for the 70% than as a piece of the last 30%. The original JV may first have been proposed as ending with 75/25; whoever at GGP insisted on 70/30 plus the 5% option mechanism may have added significant value. Itâs unrealistic to think that the price for the 5% should reflect to any great degree the âfinal fully developedâ value of Hav. If weâre talking about the possibility of 30/40/50m oz in time, the project is far from de-risked at this point. So the 5% is a staging post along the way for which GGP will receive a far higher value per % than it has to date, as a result of the successful drilling and the emergence of an amazing discovery. Talk of âuplift clausesâ etc is somewhat naive. NCM are unlikely to agree to a mechanism through which they may pay more, but have no recourse should (for example) geological or mining issues emerge. The price is likely to be the price.",No Opinion,14.7

21 Dec '21,Jmad13,Today’s news,Hi allDonât often post on here as fairly new to this but read regularly. At the AGM there was plenty of talk of a take over and now shortly after we get this news of the 5% being actioned far sooner than probably any of us would have expected.Could this be to give the SP a much needed boost and make things more difficult for any other take over attempts?Makes sense to me but only my opinion of course ,Strong Buy,14.7
21 Dec '21,stuartw6040,Ducks ducks ducks,"I have mixed feelings about todays news. Whilst I have always thought it inevitable, I didnât expect it so soon, even tho the 12 month time frame placed on us from the nov 2020 juri JV by replacing the DFS 4th stage requirement with the pfs & 20m requirement should have led me there.Itâs too early! We havenât found the edges and in fact those edges grades are getting better!!! How will we value this thing? Well, we know itâs going to likely take many years before we know the full extent. So if you had to draw a line in the sand, the mechanism chosen does seem to preclude a low or highball valuation and hint at an agreement with parties prior to this being needed. Perhaps the net end result is 100-150m paying for our loan and share of capex for the starter mine which was likely always the intention of the 5% anyway. Any overflow coupled with the placing capital could well see us progress faster than if we waited 6 more months to include more growth drilling. Have NCM pulled a fast one. Meh. An obvious one from their standpoint. Will we get fair (being the operative word) market value in feb or soon after. I doubt it. Not in our eyes. But the cash and certainty will speed us up the other side of the lassondre curve and into production and a full rerate and larger institutional positions. On balance. This felt like the bottom and todays news has cemented that imo. The only way is up now and reading the varying opinions on here and telegram today one thing is obvious.

21 Dec '21,Matty56,RE: Can we not delay the negotiation,"Everyones - I believe it is NCM's option so don't think delaying it is something anything GGP can do.More importantly I think expectations need to be managed. The 5% buy-in option is obviously to NCMs benefit - but remember it was part of the overall deal that brought NCM into the picture . One could argue that they got in for a steal for the first 70%, and that the 5% is an extension on that (though better weighted to GGP than the preceding 70%). Though I revised my initial view that the 70 (or 70+ 5 at FMV) was giving away the GGP crown jewels now I better understand that we would be nowhere near where we are, in terms of becoming 25% owners of a massive mine, if we hadn't done the deal - in fact we might have had to have flipped the lot for a low price given the difficulties we would have had with funding if going alone...",No Opinion,14.7

21 Dec '21,thelearner,RE: 20mil oz minimum,"Costa - I think that's a very good question - but I do not have an answer. The JV was minimum spend of $65m US + I think first $20m of PFS costs - would need to go back and look at the detail. So I guess the easiest way to estimate would be with drilling costs - then there are some capital costs for the camp and small roadways - not any decline works, and the costs of upgrade works at Telfer would be not included. Figure would be interesting to see how much they have spent to get 70% ownership. However FMV has to take into account the value of the gold in the ground, which is quite complex. Lots of things would come into the calc, including required CAPEX to get the minerals to Telfer, although we have a small proven resource, we have quite small CAPEX to get this out. Once the Bulk Underground mining starts - there will be more CAPEX, but regardless - because Telfer is already there, and we will be paying a toll feed for processing our 25%, CAPEX and AISC will be low - so FMV should be reasonable.",No Opinion,14.7

21 Dec '21,magictrades,RE: So now we know,"From my understanding, the value of the 5% will be independent of the share price and will be done based on the data available on the Havieron resource, gold price and the exploration targets around Havieron. The latter will be difficult to place a value on but given we are due to hear about these in the near future, I'm hoping that they have seen something in those that has prompted this decision. In terms of an organised short on GGP, I don't know if that's the case or have any proof that happens or the price being manipulated etc. I have no idea if that's a reason the SP has dived this year as much as it has. However if I were a betting man as to who might do that, NCM would make sense if they were looking for a takeout bid. Sean alludes to the risk of a takeout bid at these levels. Of course as shareholders we'd get final say so on any offer so if it was poor we'd reject it but I suppose it would lower the amount required to get the majority to vote yes. Anyway, I don't really speculate on these things.

21 Dec '21,Everyonesawinner,Can we not delay the negotiation,Can GGP not delay negotiation until later this year as it seems very one sided to NCM. If I was SD this is exactly what I would do until the overall picture unfolds on the proper value. Lets not get railroaded into a quick cheaper valuation because NCM are putting the screws on to do the deal quickly when we havent enough information. I think the MRE2 has been delayed for exactly this reason so we dont have all the information to generate the correct value. Also as I read the RNS and NCM valuation is say $50m and ours is $300m if the arbitrator finds its closer to the $50m then they will accept that figure. But they dont have all the infomration no one does. DELAY the date for me,No Opinion,14.7
21 Dec '21,Matty56,RE: So now we know,"Ynwa - but, I personally don't think it matters (for 5% negotiation) whether the formal mre2 is actually published or not as both parties will have a very good idea what's in it, as for FMV the price needs to reflect what a buyer willing to buy at and seller willing to sell at given access to their available information.I do find it interesting that if a third party is called upon they would select either/or of the FMVs submitted - i'm sure someone could right a game theory thesis based on this mechanism alone! However, I actually think NCM and GGP will work quite closely to come up with their numbers - so hopefully come in within 10% of each others.I would personally not expect to see future payments contingent on what happens/is discovered in the future. It could happen, and would be a very equitable approach, but I'd be surprised.",No Opinion,14.7

21 Dec '21,hillfog90,RE: How to value 5%,In the 12th October PFS for the SE Crescent it was stated that the GGP NPV was US$508m but Newcrest valued it at US$228m.  That means GGP valued that area at 222% of Newcrest value.  It seems there will be a great deal of negotiation to be carried out.  That report suggested that two areas of Breccia had inferred reserves of 37Mt compared to the 17Mt probable at the SE Crescent.  One suggested method of valuation suggests that probable reserves are worth 8 times the value of inferred reserves.  Does the U$1.5Bn valuation that has been suggested really add up?,No Opinion,15.05

If both parties' assessments are within 10% of each other, the option exercise price will be the average of those assessments. If both parties' assessments are not within 10% of each other, the parties will proceed to independent expert determination, with the expert being required to determine which of the values nominated by the parties is to be the fair market value.Following agreement or determination of the fair market value option exercise price, Newcrest has 30 business days to exercise its option to acquire the additional 5% interest. Proceeds from the exercise will first be used to repay the outstanding balance under the existing Newcrest loan facility.As outlined in previous announcements, most recently on 9 December 2021, following delivery of a Pre-Feasibility Study and meeting the relevant expenditure commitment, Newcrest is entitled to an additional 10% joint venture interest, and exercising this entitlement will result in an overall joint venture interest of 70% Newcrest (30% Greatland).

Believe in drilling a hole, understanding that, reflecting on it, recalibrating understanding of the region and then going back in.- Very much exploration built up from 1st principles and careful analysis, thinks over time this is the best way to create value for shareholders.",No Opinion,13.0

When the shorts drive the share price down, eliminating buyers as discussed above, some of those investors trying to sell their shares at that same time will follow the share price activity downward lowering their ask price.Now the shorts can buy back some of the shares they have shorted at lower prices including some shares where longs have put stop-loss sale orders to protect against downside losses. The shorts will only buy shares part of the way back up as the share price rises, and then wait to see if new buyers come into the market.

When the traders give up trading as the price movement becomes horizontal then probably some news will come out of nowhere to set this alight, perhaps that another Havieron has been found nearby or that Havieron is actually three times the size expected or NCM has decided to buy Havieron lock stock and barrel.

20 Dec '21,thelearner,RE: Holy Cow !!!!  Get me Superman.,"I am excited about the cores from Artemis.  But also I think like the market going to be cautious and optimistic. NCM I think with their last drill at Hav missed the ore-body by 15 metres - if they had drilled into the ore-body - GGP probably would never have got a chance at HAV. The original Hav ore body size was about 650m x 500m - maybe now 650 x 850m - but still open at depth and in several directions - where we have new targets. This Artemis mineralisation is 750m away from us - if there is mineralisation all the way from us to them - it is rally good news - and Hydrogen is absolutely correct - possibly a system of multiple breccias and pipes.  The only thing that will confirm this is drills and assays. This will take time and I am also excited waiting on the results of the 2 NCM holes to the North. Somebody asked if Artemis will have had Truescan - MRF capability - I am not sure about this - it's expensive, and relies heavily on previous calibration data - which Artemis probably have not got. Looking forward to 2022 and hopefully a share price that goes further North than the mineralisation going NW from Hav. Has anyone looked what is to the SW of Hav yet?

A few of us do and relay our thoughts on their corporate strategy and potential direction with how they may treat us in the future in regard to such matters as you are concerned about as well as others.I wrote what I think MIGHT occur in 2022 and why I'll stay invested here last week in a few posts  - that was as much for me as anyone else and I didn't spend hours drafting them, just pen to paper and flow my thoughts out, it's a useful technique to come to a decision you have been pondering for a while in my experience but also something I use if researching market sectors, spend a while researching/reading up and then just flow out some thoughts that I then build on for whatever purpose I am researching, such as for a new product or service going to market.They were highly optimistic posts (perhaps rampy!) but that is how I feel about the prospects here. Of course there are the usual risks at this stage such as issues during development, financing etc. but presently looks good to me and in the case of the former, we have a very experienced partner and contractors working on developing Hav and people in the GGP team now in place to help augment Newcrest's already impressive abilities. Plenty of geo's and those with decades of mining experience posting here and telegram too to help us understand anything like that.I think newer posters like yourself and JoeBloggs (I  remember saying you know him) could do more of the above than just falling out with other posters, constantly focusing on a low bid takeover and will help appease you.

Well we donât have assays, yet, Its not conclusive...  But the visuals donât lie.  The core looks amazing to a geo's eyeâ¦ They have the correct rocks and key presence of gold related minerals including semi-massive sulphides pyrite Â±Chalcopyrite as well as Chlorite, Actinolite infill.  Quartz-calcite vein in altered diorite with abundant pyrite chalcopyrite-chlorite- actinolite infill.   All the same as Havieorn. (but without the Sulphide crescent ) , what we are seeing is a repeat of the northern / eastern breccias in significant sizeAND What this confirms precisely is what I said 3-4 months ago that Hav is unlikely to be 1 breccia pipe .. remember?  Havieron is NOW a system of breccia pipes and dioritic dykes.  All in my humble opinion.",No Opinion,12.6
19 Dec '21,hydrogen,Holy Cow !!!!  Get me Superman.,"Someone's found Havieron's around Havieron.IMO our neighbours , ARV have just hit the jackpot :  'Dioritic Dykes ' and 'Actinolite assemblages' - ie the real good stuff when it comes to gold deposition - just 750m from Zipa ... to me that fact they hit the dioritic dykes is about as good as it gets... For the avoidance of doubt that's the same, the identical gravity target, we just put a 900m hole and an 1848m hole in at Zipa and Hav North.The source of the bulk of the gold in Havieron was until recently a 'slight mystery', when about 3-4 months ago NCM revealed in some new work published by NCM at the Diggers & Dealers conference.  Frazer Macqourdale described clusters of new  NW trending dioritic - gold bearing - dykes, intruded into the centre of the Havieron oval, which had not previously been observed (adjacent to the barren Mafic Dyke ...) The Diorites form the meat, the very heart of the higher gold grades Havieron deposit - they show up as a pale green in the very recent plan view -sections.  with NW trending orientation.  These are also now thought to be directly associated with the eastern and northern breccia. Turning to the ARV report:  Hole GDRCD007 drilled from the Apollo, AP3 pad (Fig. 4) intersected // an ~84m interval of an altered diorite intrusion. This hole has been plugged at 804m and will be re- entered and pushed deeper   ""Furthermore, in GDRCD007, zones of disseminated sulphides were observed within the matrix of the diorite intrusion itself""  That, it seems, is what they have just found at Apollo....  Its the same gold bearing dyke characteristics, textures and mineral assemblage as the core of Havieron...The central zone of Havieron (ie Havierons around Havieron) have, it appears, just been located.  IN fact That Apollo gravity target, in all fairness, looks to be more on our side of the boarder than ARVs side.I quote : âEncouragingly, the presence of altered diorite, a high-temperature alteration assemblage and high sulphide content of selected core zones encountered in GDRCD007 bear strong similarities to published examples of some host rock and vein-hosted mineralisation sub-types at the nearby multi-million ounce Havieron mine development.ââWith drill pads between 300m and 2km apart, Havieron-sized orebodies could easily slip between our first-pass Phase 1 drill net which makes the update presented today even more satisfyingâ.âAltered diorite is reportedly one of the key host rocks present in the centre of the Havieron Mineral Resource. The high-temperature alteration suite, veins combined with significant sulphide mineralisation within this diorite also bears a striking resemblance to reported sub-types at the massive Havieron Au-Cu deposit nearbyâPt1",No Opinion,12.6

19 Dec '21,hydrogen,Wow what a shi7 fest tonight ...!  News must be coming soon.,"Not sure why anyone would attempt to sow so much disruption and discord.     BUT I can think of multiple reasons why a GGP takeover bid could come tomorrow or the day after : Whilst there is some exploration risk to any buyer,  in justifying such an early premium weighted transaction to, for example, NCM shareholders, overall, from NCM's perspective the sooner the better for any bid : 1) NCM know more about this deposit than anyone. It's obviously ginormous and just gets bigger.  2) I predict Zipa and HaV north will be two more pipes: ie  'Havierons around Havieron"".  Frazer Macquordale General Manager Exploration Newcrest Mining Limited no less said it, (not me!).  3)FACT is Hav is incredible on every levels (apart from 420m of Permian cover) Multi decade, high grade prospect, next to Telfer is a dream come true4) We are not fully funded to production (just yet). Heddles idea of the 5% option was to leverage the deposit (and $50m loan) to get into production - bad idea as we dont want to dilute yet we are c$100m short... .  So without debt funding secured it's problematic and we are vulnerable to a bid.  5) And How do you achieve FMV on something that's still growing...?  whilst getting into production? 6)A BID solves ALL these problem of trying to achieve FMV for the 5% - juts take the lot, at a suitable price GGP SH will accept. A clean execution. 7) THe wider macroeconomic view is seriously in gold's favour.  Gold could get quite expensive by the end of 2023/24 so and early transaction makes absolute sense. 8) we could see also a period of drying up of liquidity - GFC 2 style - so finding finding options may get tricky, even for NCM later. 9) the incredible amount of manipulation to take this down and squeeze out PIs is indicative of a bid. Shaun Day more or less said it himself.. Now you have coked up Jtrader22  with his 71 posts in 48 hours (excluding the deleted ones)... something stinks real bad.Newcrest  sorry but  -  In my view it's a case of ""Heads I win, Tales you lose"" LTH know the score and we are happy to sit this one out.

19 Dec '21,bluetigeruk,Takeover thoughts,I don't see a takeover unless it's agreed between GGP and Newcrest.  And I definitely don't see any third party either.  They can't bid as the symbiosis better the two is so high.  A bid from anyone else would just act as a stalking horse for Newcrest and so third party would always lose and it would cost them their corporate finance fees which for a Â£750 bid would cost say ... Â£20 million. So there's no takeover around unless it's agreed and that won't happen for 5 years yet until the area has been fully explored and valued.  Thanks Blue,No Opinion,12.6

The banks are in a mess and have only been able to clear approx10k short contracts whilst HNW individuals are demanding more and more physical gold to be delivered from the COMEX and it is a distinct possibility that the short swaps will be totally overrun making the paper market irrelevant (20 years too late ).   The refiners have no gold for large immediate deliveries and delivery for silver is well into 2022. Central banks and commercial banks are loading up with physical gold and at these ridiculously low prices so should you. The time for waiting for a entry into physical gold is over.

I just post honest opinion and try to keep my opinion and thoughts balanced.It's unfortunate at the present time at the SP and for many holding GGP shares but I'm sure there's many holders of other AIM junior mining shares who are in the same boat.It's not been a great year but the diffrrence for me is that GGP have a share in Havieron and other juniors maybe  have possible future prospects but still lots of exploration to do. Also we have a joint venture with a major, so we are well ahead of the pack.  It is having Havieron that will help with the GGP SP recovery but IMO it will take a bit longer than many anticipated at the start of the year, but at least we have a target date (approx) to production; so if people want real value out of this share then they need to have patience and resilience until they get to the target price they want.Lol, I do get where you're coming from regarding the comment about your wife, as I have some friends and probably my brother whose wives might not be so understanding.

18 Dec '21,GGPThruandtru,AGM Recap,"So was going to write this just after watching the AGM, but the board has been so busy this week, thought it was pointless. So I watched it again. I like to think I âknowâ and am able to  âreadâ people. As much as I wanted to watch the AGM whilst being annoyed at SD for the raise and the way he handled it, as soon as he started, I canât help but like him. The thing about Shaun âMulti-Factorialâ Day is that heâs a WORKER BEE. Heâs not and never has been a lifestyle CEO. Heâs worked his way up in various companies including Northern Star by actually doing a job. And thatâs what heâs doing here. Quietly and confidently going about his business hoping to create a lasting legacy in a company he clearly wants to be a part of for a long and hopefully prosperous time. He âenjoysâ what he does. You can see it by the way he talks to us and about his business. He acknowledges us PIâs on a regular basis, including all the daft questions he keeps getting asked about the SP and other stuff. The whole âtakeoverâ thing started online, not from within GGP. We put him in that position and he needed to address it. That leads to the other aspect that has been mentioned here multiple times. âSD is a company man and doesnât care about us lowly PIâsâ. - I wasnât sure also to start with, but again at the AGM he directly addressed all the PI issues we had here in the weeks pre-AGM. He addressed:- the extra 0 in the resolution- the decline queries (soft rock slower and as we get to the hard stuff it will speed up - just like certain people on this board have been saying for ages)- the cap raise (banks donât lend 100%)Clearly he listens to us and even answers the daft questions. How can we not appreciate that? And then the worker bee goes on to mention âhis teamâ - thatâs what heâs been working on all year and he seems chuffed with what heâs creating.ESG funds are massive and will be even bigger in the future of a hopefully âgreen planetâ - he likes those too.  Heâs so many steps ahead of us, itâs not funny. Yes, the SP sucks but SD feels this too. You can sense it. He canât wait for it to recover a little so he can really start to enjoy himself. Trust the process, trust the fundamentals and letâs try and trust SD. Letâs stop with the takeover malarkey cos clearly heâs not interested. The little worker bee is busy going about collecting the honey and making sure weâre ready to make that transition to a term he used a few times in the AGM.

Thinks during the course of this year that theyâve built credibility with them.The most recent equity raise saw some 20 IIâs new to the register come in, some with relatively measured parcels and it is all about them building confidence and engagement with GGP.Relevant catalysts such as the ESG report, updated resource estimates, funding/ bank financing, getting up to London to meet people in person are all important events and factors in the first half of 2022 and are in parallel with 90,000m of growth drilling and these continued exploration updates.Every geologist, every mining engineer, every person watching those updates just grows in confidence about the opportunity at Havieron.(Q) - Can GGP be taken over without Private Investor approval?(A) - The answer is No. Fundamentally, if a takeover bid was received and the BOD thought it warranted being put to shareholders it would ultimately be in the hands of the shareholders. It would obviously have to be a compelling bid, this is a unique ore body with a low-risk pathway to free cash flow.Ultimately, it's the shareholders that determine bid outcomes but my gosh I think weâd want to extract a premium for an asset of this quality.(Q) - Shaun, do you think the share price is undervalued?(A) - Yes, itâs a tremendous ore body in a tier 1 jurisdiction next to infrastructure. Globally unique, hard to see an asset of this quality in a jurisdiction like this with a quick pathway to production, expect to be in free cash flow in CY 2024, this is for a discovery from 2019 that literally in 2 yearsâ time we have started developing.That is unusual, the typical timeframe to develop an asset in Australia is around 10 years, talks to the quality of Hav, the conviction of GGP and perhaps Newcrest too in being willing to support putting Hav into production early.Unique proposition and states shareholders of GGP should be popping champagne corks every day about the quality of this ore body and how it consistently and predictably continues to deliver.Alex Borelli closes AGM with thoughts on share price and takeovers.Analysts report valuations in the market on GGP currently have expectations that the SP should be around the mid 20âs and above.If there is a takeover approach, there is a formal process that is adopted, although not subject to shareholder approval, a form of acceptance will go to shareholders from an offeror, but the offeror would seek to have a board recommendation and it is incumbent on us to have a valuation report on the company.So we would go through the motions of being totally considered on the value of any offer that was received, but of course weâre",No Opinion,12.6

Benefits of building a team with mining and process skills is that we understand the value of the asset better and better.Some processes that they undertake internally, such as updated resource and reserve estimates are another factor in understanding the asset better. Thinks the value of Hav is considerably substantial, you go through your whole career in mining looking for world class ore bodies in tier 1 locations and the fact that we have the additional conflux of sitting by existing infrastructure, a global major operating and being the manager with GGP is further decreasing the risk with rooms full of mining engineers, indigenous engagement, environmental permitting people that they can deploy to this asset have extraordinary low risk, low capex pathway to free cash flow and potentially a multi decade mine.Value is extraordinary and over time the will continue to communicate and create that value.(Q) - When can we expect to see the Juri JV assay results which have been due since November?(A) - Results still not back despite the expansion of Lab infrastructure in Western Australia which was envisaged in helping to improve turnarounds.Just starting to get some results through, but they need to be processed, also did an Electrical Magnetic Survey up on some of the Juri / Scallywag ground as well, quite a long tail of interpretation on that which is going to be coming through shortly too.Like to get it out when all in, hopefully in weeks not months likely very early in New Year now.It is drifting in, bit of a slow burn, believe m",No Opinion,12.6

Believe in drilling a hole, understanding that, reflecting on it, recalibrating understanding of the region and then going back in.Very much exploration built up from 1st principles and careful analysis, thinks over time this is the best way to create value for shareholders.(Q) - Answering questions related to share price decline despite the excellent news flow?",No Opinion,12.6

17 Dec '21,WelshFalcon,RE: Fact,"One aspect that is conveniently missed is that making a successful hostile takeover is very difficult and expensive.To actually be successful you need to be pretty sure, when hitting the 'go' button, that you have (potentially) enough shareholder support. Normally done by building a critical holding, along with positive indications from other (institutional) shareholders. Before you spend a lot of time and money, your plan has to include a high degree of potential positive outcome.When you look at our shareholders, there is no one company in a position to even start to think about a hostile bid, no one anywhere near the 20 to 30% that would be needed. Neither is there any other share holder (or groups of shareholders) that can push the total over 50% with their support. You might be able to scare some PIs into acceptance, but you won't get them all. In our case you will need to persuade a large percentage, the same people who can easily be 'educated' by response from our BOD. To go for a company such as GGP, you have a lot of expensive hoops to jump through with a very uncertain result.The risk (and cost) of failure would be too high with the share register as currently presented.

17 Dec '21,Dip666,RE: Time to decide,"- Shaun Day, our CEO, is building an exceptionally strong team augmenting the old exploration team with very highly experienced and skilled individuals in mining and processing related areas that could quite easily choose to work elsewhere than an explorer thatâs just transitioned to a developer. He has a team to protect our interest in Havieron in place and a team that could help us develop our own 100% managed projects if we hit another discovery as oppose to requiring a JV to deliver full shareholder value.- Both GGP and NCM exploration teams have grown a massively greater understanding of how Havieron was formed, how the regional geology may be holding more Havieronâs, both in our existing Havieron mining lease and across the Paterson where we also share the additional Juri JV with Newcrest and have our own 100% owned tenements. - Newcrest are  applying cutting edge technology in conjunction with a huge amount of experienced experts, a compelling combination for further success. Clear evidence of this belief is the drilling at our Havieron tenement border at Zipa/Hav North with our neighbours Artemis also working on their side at Apollo etc.- Presentations at Diggers and Dealers, NewGen Gold Conference from the senior Newcrest exploration staff, the brief interview on Juri results from GGPâs John McIntyre during 2021 display both teams have strong beliefs in other Havieronâs in the Paterson region and are using more informed exploration techniques using particular methodologies to garner more success hopefully, Shaunâs comments from the AGM also touched upon this outlining a focused exploration approach in favour over Pattern Drilling- The financing: we have feasible routes to paying our share of development costs both towards production on the SLOS mining front and then further on as we move into expanding through bulk mining techniques etc. and based on comments in the AGM I suspect Shaun may look to close on one of the term sheets by mid 2022- The Lassonde Curve: well looking at that at some point we will be looking at a far far better share price but may take time, but I do expect 2022 to throw up a low of macro developments that make GGP a very attractive investment when money flows back into the sector- Full takeover or sale of Havieron risks: I expect a premium will be paid on both counts IF these scenarios occur and although disappointed personally, a win  - especially a major win is exceptional on AIM and will be life changing for many of us.- I also think the risk of a takeover is another reason for the previous Equity raise, besides aiding Shaun in obtaining bank funding we can go hell for leather on our exploration targets outside Havieron and the Juri JV and hopefully build value through positive results in case a take-over bid emerges.",No Opinion,12.75
17 Dec '21,Dip666,RE: Time to decide,"Like many, I have friends and family invested here asking on my thoughts on the future of GGP as the year closes as many of them have now been invested around a 12 month timeline so sat on a capital loss, so thought Iâd articulate what Iâve been discussing with them, hopefully again, helps some here : -  Havieron itself has massive growth potential from itâs existing official resource estimates, itâs going to get much much bigger and reflect this officially through studies and resource/reserve numbers that can be quantified and utilised for attracting investment, obtaining financing etc. - officially may I add again - something that really matters- The PFS was for a âfraction of a fractionâ of the ore body i.e a section of the SE Crescent which is a section of the overall ore body, over time there will be graduating studies after the FS and from my understanding during production that continue to expand the operational capacity and resource estimates, including the Eastern Breccia and bulk mining fronts which looks more and more likely to combat for even the most ardent detractor. Quite likely that Havieron will be running far past the time many of us have left this mortal coil.- The fact is, weâll be shareholders through GGP in potentially the 2nd lowest cost gold mine globally, I mean - globallyâ¦â¦with potential to decrease these costs further down- Our partner: Newcrest is one of the worldâs largest gold mining companies, obviously focusing on Tier 1 low cost operations across the world, they are leading experts in the very techniques required to mine Havieron and like many majors focused on displaying growth and longevity to their own shareholders- Intuition tells me the Eastern Breccia is going to grow in size just as we saw Havieron take shape from a few holes to forming a half ellipse to a full ellipse and then seeng the pockets fill up and overspills as evidenced in the exploration reports (using very very simple terms!). Obviously if youâre able to build a 3D picture in your head itâs far more complex than trying to envisage from flat 2D images so I appreciate some are struggling to comprehend as we all have different brains.- Newcrest have 1200 staff with highly valuable experience at Telfer that they absolutely want to retain and they will do everything to avoid a gap between Telferâs rapidly diminishing output and Havieronâs production commencement to retain them, once gone, the best would have been snapped up by other companies in a massively under resourced sector desperate for personnel, services and equipment***continued***",No Opinion,12.75

17 Dec '21,Floater,Victims Of Our Own Success,"So here was me last night moaning to the wife about the SP and how much it has went down this year; of course she said we could have sold up in December/January - even February or  March, and then at least we would have made some money, plus our kids would have made profit on their ISA's;  Hindsight is a great thing.I did say to her that we are victims of our own success but I also reminded her that when I invested her and the children's money then it would be 2-4, maybe 5 years for true value to come (the wife is 45, and 14 years younger than me).Although I bought 114k shares in 2018, I never started buying more until May 2020, when the price was going up and up and it was clear there was great fundamentals with Havieron. When I moved my old works pensions over then I bought more in August to November and even a large chunk on the 18th January, 2 days before initial scally results. The ""victims of our own success"" comment comes from the fact that actually since buying buying heavily from June 2020 onwards then all we really got was a meteoric rise to December. We never seen massive drops apart from maybe after the first few days/week after the first GDXJ buy-in.  By that time we were up on paper anyway, so no matter the price fluctuations down then we were still sitting on profit, so why worry - and we bought more in the mid 20's up to the low 30's because the fundamentals at Havieron had not changed since we had been buying in the teens prices. So when the scally results came in and there was the massive sell off drop and then recovery we were still in profit, so why worry.Fast forward to now and look where we are. In all my families investments then we are approx 50% down with me quite substantially in my SIPP - this is real money down and not in paper profits.  Obviously I accept I'm an amateur share owner and should have maybe top sliced at some point; but again the fundamentals at Havieron had not changed, so why should I have worried, we were never massively down. So at this point then I have to remember a comment from Rick Rule, I don't know the exact words - but at some point in your investment then you could be 50% down, but if it's a good share and you believe in the research and/or fundamentals then you hold it. I believe in the fundamentals for Greatland and Havieron; the gold is still there and it will be coming out of the ground, so I'm holding on. If there is a buyout then there is nothing I can do except maybe vote for what I think is the best offer. As my wife said last night - no point in worrying about it as it is what it is and you can't do anything about it unless you sell at a loss, if you believe in yourself and what you know, then it will come good in the next few years.

Current 12.5p makes for an easy calc.Which one is FMV? Whilst  SD, backed by his recurring open-in-all-directions data, constantly talks up the resource, conversely we see ever-decreasing value. This is plain manipulation. Somebody wants that sp down. The greatest beneficiary here is Newcrest. 5% of Â£1bn is Â£50m. If the current sp is FMV, they can take it for Â£25m, a big saving.It gets worse for GGP shareholders when the remaining 30% of the Co. is up for grabs. An offer can now come in at 20p, that being a 50% premium to the present valuation. Even after a bidding war, 20p , being a 50% premium,,suddenly is looking like a good take-out price.  Is it a stealth thing with a big ii at work, there are plenty of corrupt ones out there  with form for doing the dirty work of price-fixing.

16 Dec '21,magictrades,Time to decide,"By opening LSE today and seeing over 400 messages on the board and some of the titles I can sense a lot of angst. To be honest for good reason, the share price stinks. I'm not going to pretend to be happy about it or say its great value or spin it in any other way, no call a spade a spade - the share price is w***. I would suspect at least 60% of this board  are in the mud and stuck in quite bad in many cases. Even those who got in at 10-12p are now essentially breakeven. Those that were in long before below 10p have seen thousands disappear this year to market (assuming nobody sold anything). So absolutely nobody that is long here, will be happy with the performance this year.I've been doing some of my own reflecting on the company, my investment and the situation. To be clear, I think GGP has the best gold deposit on the AIM market. With the additional exploration targets too, I think GGP is in the top 5% of junior miners in terms of quality on the market. However I think it's important to understand a good company doesn't necessarily make a good stock and the truth is absolutely NO commodity stock this year has been a good stock. We're here to make money, if we're not doing that something is wrong. More times than not, it's our decision making, our risk management, our emotions that are the issue. I've mentioned before about the lassonde curve and that I believe we are between the two peaks. Havieron's hype is finished, that caused the 1st peak. The ride up the 2nd peak will be in the next few years, developing the mine and benefiting from its production. GGP is no longer a trade as it was the past year or two. If you're looking for big 200% gains in a matter of days, you won't find it here. Based on all of this, here are some thoughts/question to ask yourself to decide what to do next.1. Do I understand what Havieron is, the timescales involved and the exploration targets GGP has?  2. Am I a trader or an investor? - Basically how long am I willing to be here for?3. If I am a trader, where is my stop loss?4. What is the maximum loss I am willing to take? 5. Do I trust the board of directors to deliver the plan they have?I think these 5 questions will help alot. For example, if you are a trader who bought above 20p, you should have sold a long time ago. Conversely, if you are an investor, the maximum you are willing to lose defines your stop loss essentially. Absolutely everybody here is in their own situation. But now is the time to decide what to do. If you have to sell because the loss is too much to handle, then do it because mentally its not worth the stress. If you have to sell because you don't want to be here for 2 years or more, then do it because this isn't the share for you. However if you are here for the longer term, then good because the strong hands will forge the bottom from which this will hopefully take off from",No Opinion,12.5

16 Dec '21,hydrogen,Cannacord Note 9th December 2021 PRICE 25p,"FLASH: A focus on resource growth in 2022Canaccord Genuity viewHitting gold in step out holesGreatland Gold has provided an update to the exploration and development program at the Havieron JV with Newcrest. The latest results have incorporated 24 newinfill and growth drill holes (with all encountering mineralisation, and 19 holes encountering significant mineralisation - including a highlight of 113.8m @ 3.4g/t Au & 0.1% Cu from 996m). The majority of recent holes have focussed on infill drilling as the JV partners look to grow confidence in the resource base ahead of the Feasibility Study, due next year (following the recent PFS, which only considered a small fraction of the total resource base). Further, growth drilling has confirmed extension of SE Crescent mineralisation over 250m from the Inferred Mineral Resource extents. Drilling continues to assess the depth extents of the SE Crescent which now hasa vertical extent of over 900m. All drilling is now focused on growth programs (with multiple identified targets) which will continue into FY22E with eight drill rigs operational, and 90,000m of drilling planned.In our initiation of GGP, we suggested the key driver for GGPâs value was the delineation of additional resources, which would support a larger operation to feed Newcrest's existing plant at nearby Telfer. We believe that the incorporation of ongoing growth drilling will support a significantly larger development (than the one outlined in the recent PFS) when the feasibility study is completed towards the end of 2022E. We believe recent share price weakness makes valuation pushback on GGP increasingly difficult to justify. Maintain SPECULATIVE BUY and 25p target.",No Opinion,12.5

16 Dec '21,gymboy,6 years in GGP seen it all before,"The first thing I have to say is good luck to all who are invested here. If you are not invested in GGP, what are you doing here. Are you knocking the stock for a lower entry point or a shorter, why not state your position. As a long term holder of GGP (i have been here since 2015) with my first entry point at 0.06p I am up just over 200 times with those particular shares. In the last six years I have seen my holding go up in value by 10 fold only to half in value weeks later. This stock flies when its in vogue and falls back in between. The stock got ahead of itself late 2020 but is now undervalued. I won't be selling any for quite a while yet until GGP. There is just so much going on over the next 12 months. GGP have so many irons in the fire that eventually a value way beyond todays value will be achieved. No doubt someone is going to tell me I'm in the wrong and now is the time to sell. I have been told that many times over the last 6 years and thank goodness I ignored them every time.The SP could drop a little further who knows just whats playing out. What I do understand is the gold and copper that has been discovered so far and the potential for further discoveries to put that to be way beyond any figure released in January will eventually have a massive impact on the SP to who knows what level.I wouldn't say I am sitting on my hands as such,  just playing the long game which has paid massive dividends so far.",Strong Buy,12.5
16 Dec '21,hydrogen,Dr Brett Davis:  When the Data Goes Public - Get ready to be impressed,"Once the MRE is delivered, GGP will have 30% of whatever the December MRE JORC upgrade delivers. That could be anywhere between 6 and 10-moz, I expect.. But in truth very hard to know exactly what they will be able to include as that is down to drilling density - 75m x 75m for inferred and 45x45m  grid spacing for indicated has been achieved and NCM are always rather conservative. This recent PFS mainly detailed the investment case, the mine design, the relevant costings and projection for AISC processing and profitability... which started extremely conservative, typical of NCM but the metrics delivered the 2nd lowest cost gold mine GLOBALLY. This is why the trolls are here... this is there window to snatch you're shares.  The key bit is the PFS can also be used to justify a $70m loan at a low cost of capital.  What that mean is instos who want to buy in donât have the upper hand anymore, to buy in cheaply.  Equally the instos are happy to issue the debt due to takeover risk - they get paid back more quickly. We bank the PFS. Then arrange a large loan and proceed to build the mineâ¦. This protects us form predators... And Any instos that 'want in' going forward can then either buy on market, like us, or maybe buy a few more off Callum or whatever should  he/they decide to do so going forwards.The point is the Institutional investors will want in.  Once they see understand the scale of the investment proposition Havieron is.. and how it just is getting bigger every day.  No to mention the grade and cost metrics improving with depth and so on... This geology is so unique and incredible that the Havieron copper gold deposit is already considered in a class of its own globally. That's what's happening hence Geologists like the world renowned Structural Geologist, Dr Brett Davis, in interview was asked recently: What is the most interesting deposit you have ever worked at? ( He lists a few like Northern Star's Kanowna Belle orogenic gold deposit and the Chalice Deposit...) But then he talks about Havieron: ""The Havieron deposit in north Western Australia is a beautiful deposit with amazing world-class textures. This is a relatively new discovery and much of the geological detail hasnât reached the public yet, but when it does, people will be seriously impressed. Full kudos to the drillers who have managed to provide consistently oriented core over hole lengths approaching 2 km (Ë 1 mi)."" Yup 2km!! you read that correct .... 2km DEEP.  That's like to the Centre of the Earth continuous mineralisation.  And its efficient and even more ecumenic due to the perfect verticality of the ore body.

There's something new, about how it formed - the genesis of Havieron - and it's completely unique coming...  It's going to be a world first.   And it's very, very exciting for everyone involved.  The early Havieron GGP theory was that the gold showed up via magnetic anomalies. That has now been proven to be completely wrong.   The new Eastern breccia zones show no magnetic anomaly.   SO what they've now realised is what actually occured was multiple mineralisation 'overprint' events, over geological time, and this confused things... some led to magnetic and gravity annomlies and some didn't.  But they've now realised the high grade gold didn't. It leaves no Geophysical magnetic anomaly whatsoever. And that changes how they drill Targets outside the means zone... And more importantly for us How they Drill Scallywag.   I'm excited for the prospect of a new discovery.",No Opinion,12.5

Many are questioning their investing integrity and thoughts range from being sucked up in the madness that was the build up to the GDXJ of 2020, with FOMO.....to wondering if they can ever make a  dilligent prudent financial investment ever again.Now is the time to take a deep breath and have a conversation with yourself about what to do next.

Are the resource figures bandied about - for real, or imaginary?2. Who is actually doing all the digging and are they experts in their industry?3. Has the time line to production changed markedly?4.

16 Dec '21,Floater,RE: This Board Has Too Much Frustration,"Seems like the frustration is starting to creep into the threads.Everyone who is genuinely invested in this share is frustrated at the present time and quite understandably so.  None of the PI's can explain exactly why we are here and in theory then it doesn't really make sense with the asset we have at Havieron, as it has only got bigger since last year.    The fundamentals from last year are actually better and we all know there is more news to come, especially the updated MRE. We all know when production is due to start and until then it will probably be a frustrating journey, but it is a long game and if you still believe in the fundamentals then you need to hold on for the journey.  It is what it is and if some of you remove the blinkers then you will see that the vast majority of juniors have taken a bashing this year. That includes two Canadian juniors and one Australian junior I'm invested in, so it's not just AIM listed juniors and it's just the way the market is working and of course due to global economics and the Covid Pandemic.  We have a better asset than most of all the other juniors but if the sentiment and money is not in the metals exploration sector then nothing will really change until these two factors change or there is great news.You either tough it out until we rise on better news, the sentiment and money comes back in or we get to production but you just need to keep the patience for the long game.",No Opinion,12.85

Sitting in Australia blaming covid restrictions for not being at the AGM is a classic example.  He even said at the AGM he needs to be face to face with potential investors. There were no real restrictions and he took the easy option to stay home.  Bad form from a CEO matched by his unwillingness to invest in his own company.  The paltry Â£50k in the placing was almost obligatory and showed little outward belief in the bargain basement price attributed by the market.

16 Dec '21,Floater,This Board Has Too Much Frustration,"Unfortunately the board has went downhill; maybe a controlled move by a few trolls but let's be honest and say that some genuine members have also got drawn in by their tactics and let themselves get involved in petty squabbles with them which results in many posts/threads being deleted and many posters switching off from the board.Yes, it can be argued that there has to be some pushback on misinformation and some posters respond well to this and answer constructively; but many of the threads just deteriorate in personal slanging matches and attacks which is not good reading.As I'm invested in several shares then I do go onto to other boards but don't post on them, and I can say now that IMO then this board has probably the best overall knowledgeable people posting great information about GGP, NCM, mining, geo, etc.  As my main investment is with GGP and actually felt like I had a good home here for the first 9-12 months after I joined LSE in June 2020.  I am not overly technical but was posting some occasional bits of information I thought useful and provided feedback in threads I think that was reasonably balanced.  Occasionally I got drawn into troll threads and commented when I was suspicious of them and their motives, but realised I was only probably fueling their fire and keeping their posts at or near the top of the board, Hence I started creating threads for 'Ignoring the Trolls' - which went unheeded.  Having been on quite a few other boards then it is much the same and they are littered will trolls spreading FUD and in reality it's just part of the boards and social media and life in general. No matter where you think or want success then there will always be people trying to knock you down.  Of course a good measured response if delivered in the right way can push back or silence the haters and actually it can make other genuine members be aware of them but when frustration enters the fray and the responses start to deteriorate into playground behaviour with name calling, etc then the valid argument starts to demise and it just puts other posters off reading or taking part in genuine debate.It is quite obvious that the mood on the board is being affected by the slide in the SP, and personally I am now down a substantial amount on my actual investment - not a paper loss - really down in monetary terms, but I'm sure it will recover.  I live with this unfortunate circumstance at this moment in time but I take full responsibility for it; I pressed the button to buy and I accept there is no one else to blame.  Of course it's frustrating for me but there are many on this board in the same situation and down varying amounts of money, and I share your pain; but my frustration is mine to bear and I do not bring it to this board; I only ask that others should try to do the same and not bring their disappointment or frustration to the boards.",No Opinion,13.1

The deposit is wide open so as Newcrest continues to drill it while they soon start driving an underground decline, I am certain the deposit will get a lot bigger. Newcrest should take them over but if Newcrest feels the takeover would be to expensive, the worst case scenario is that Newcrest starts mining this very profitable deposit and doesnât takeover GGP, then Newcrest will have to share 25% of the profit from the mining operation meaning GGP turns into a very profitable miner and would be re-rated accordingly.

Keep it real guys, this game is longer than many want and it is definitely twisting emotions.Walking on eggshells.08 Dec 2021 06:45Walking on eggshells, yes, that's what it's like to post on this forum these days. If you don't upset one mindset then you certainly upset the opposite mindset, no matter what your view or opinion.The time for civil and cordial views and opinions re GGP are long gone and all because of money, money the root of all evil and evil now resides on this forum.Greed, avarice, self indulgence and pleonexia, all the tools of the Devil. The thing is, we're all in the same boat and not one poster, whether for, against or just indifferent towards GGP sp, can make anything change.IMO the CEO has not helped this situation, but that's my view and I'm entitled to it, without fear of abuse, ridicule or name calling. Those that see no wrong from SD, then that's your view and you're entitled to it.Expectations went way too high, there are IMO things that don't sit well with me on a few issues, but I'll keep them to myself.Too many people have become emotionally attached to this stock and the CEO. 2020 sp action took over rational thinking and many struggle to deal with 2021 events, which has caused concern despair and anxiety.I suspect many are seriously over-exposed here based on last years euphoria, yet not one person will admit to that, as is human nature.I believe in this asset, though I still have my reservation about SD and as value continues to erode under his stewardship, so my confidence in him will continue to wane. That said he still has much to do to restore value and confidence, 12 months in situ is when to judge him firmly.He presides over one of the strongest assets and fundamentals on Aim, to use a football analogy on sp performance, it's like missing a penalty with no goalkeeper.We PI's are divided on the raise, some for and some against, whatever your belief, it's no reason to ridicule. Whatever the malicious malevolent underhand machinations by the unclean are doing behind our backs, we need to live with it because posting here won't stop it, angst, belligerent behavior and in fighting between members here won't stop it.I know that, they know that and your need to accept that or put your dough in the bank.That said, it will come right when certain catalysts kick in, of which there are many. These catalysts may take several more months or longer to come through.In general the PI forward thinking mentality to investing is short to medium term, the big unclean money thinking is the long game, if your finances allow you to play the long game then you will win, unfortunately, not all have the same financial time horizons, this is the catalyst that allows the darker side of people to emerge in their posts.Â This is still a long play, but a very big play.United we stand, divided we fall.GLA",No Opinion,13.4

15 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: Take over,"@JoeBloggsUk - GGP itself canât be bought without 75% shareholder consent. A sale of part (or all) of GGPâs interest in Hav might or might not require shareholder consent, depending on the size/materiality of any such proposed transaction vs the 5 class tests.@sandgrounded - Private investors could organise themselves to have more of a say than they do today through a shareholder action group or similar, although Iâm not sure this could be done effectively after a transaction was notified. If someone wants to do this, they should probably get on with itâ¦ https://www.sharesoc.org/Shareholder%20Action%20Groups.pdf@Tildo - in the event of a Â£1.5bn offer for the remaining 30% of Hav shareholder consent would be sought. Itâs hard to see approval being given without some commitment to a special dividend (or buy-back..?).@Matty - any shares accumulated before an offer *could* have an impact on the level of an offer. Simplistically, if you buy shares in the three months before an offer is announced, your offer cannot be on less favourable terms. I think that C is most likely only because it is probably the âsafestâ option for NCM - it avoids a lot of the noise and risks associated with a full offer. GGP might push for a full offer to be made thoughâ¦ All part of the negotiation game! You are right that NCM holds the whip hand with respect to third parties.@JiffyBag - I agree that GGP can sit tight, as long as it has the financial resources to meet its JV commitments. NCM could choose to be less accommodative in that regard, although the eyes of the mining world will watch how it treats GGP. Itâs a tricky balance. In terms of the timing of a valuation, donât forget that NCM has a mechanism (via the option for the last 5%) to âforceâ a valuation during the next 12 months. I would expect GGP to seek a premium for the remaining 25%, although the 5% would be a line in the sand from which anything further would be measured.@Floater - a lot will depend on whether NCM are happy to stick at 70%. If not I would expect them to move (one way or another) for the remaining 30%. This process will start with the optioned 5%. If the value of the remaining 25% is increasing NCM will likely be motivated to move sooner rather than later. All part of the great negotiationâ¦.@Kieffy - Iâm sure SD will be looking for a great deal for GGP shareholders. The process around the optioned 5% could be the starting gun for NCM. Remember that the JV agreement says that an independent valuation will be used if agreement isnât otherwise reached. Such a valuation would be binding for the 5% should NCM wish to proceed.@BiggL - I donât think the offset provision matters other than to NCM. It means only that any loan balance is cleared before proceeds can be used for other purposes. Iâd expect that to happen in any case.",No Opinion,13.9

15 Dec '21,Floater,RE: Take over,"Re: Option C I'm sure I heard SD stating that Havieron is a world class asset.  He has not put the vastly experienced board together to just roll over for an offer of Greatland, all of Havieron or even just the 5% NCM option.   As Jiffy has said, at the present time no-one knows how much the 5% or 30% of Havieron is worth and I don't think a fair guestimate can be determined until at least after the updated MRE.  Even then the MRE might not have taken in all of the drilling results for 6 weeks or a few months before release, so IMO any offer would have to take into account a reasonable amount of possible/probable future growth.But lets not forget the 5% or 30% of Havieron includes all of the 12 blocks within the  E45/4701 tenement, so this also includes any possible mineralisation finds at Zipa, Hav north and any other possible targets within the area.  It could be that GGP will want to see what else NCM turns up with further exploration of these identified targets before agreeing to sell 5% or even the 30% (as some on here suggest). Also take into account 'every hole hits mineralisation' and 'open at depth' and sides', so how do you get to a sale price when you know the drill cores are providing results - even up to a few days - before you enter negotiations; IMO it's difficult to determine a figure when you actually still don't know the estimated full extent of mineralisation.Taking this information into account then IMO it will be difficult to get an agreed figure for the 5% never mind 30% for the near future (at least next 3-4 months and after the updated MRE) but I do think that the agreement for the 5% option will come into play for Greatland to finance their share of the works at Havieron, so some price will have to be determined.   As for the other 25% ? IMO then Greatland will not want to part with this as it's a company maker and if they do then it will not be cheap - in the $billions; but I also think NCM will be happy with their 70/75% knowing it will feed Telfer for years to come so therefore no need to spend $billions requiring an asset they already have the lions share of.Any the other options are possible but I think SD, the board and shareholders will push back on any low ball offer, so any offer will have to look reasonably good before acceptance - 60+p for starters !!",No Opinion,14.0

15 Dec '21,Matty56,RE: Take over,"Starbright - interesting scenarios and of course there are others and many more potential procedural steps that might need to be taken depending on board reaction, whether/how many shares are accumulated before an offer for the remainder Etc. Etc. Etc.My question would be why you see option C would be most likely. I can understand NCM wanting to buy out GGP stake in Havieron - I find it harder to understand why GGP would sell it - only if the offer was absolutely enormous (seen as significantly better than holding on to the 25/30% of expected future asset/cash flow values) would it be in shareholders' interests to take the cash (to Tildo's question, we would effectively all hold a share of that cash and share price would reflect that - but it would likely track down unless everyone believed the cash would be put to good use e.g., if we had success in another area. Perhaps more likely that a special dividend would be paid - which would drop the share price - and we/the market would make a call on value of the company with whatever cash not paid out + expectations of future performance from the team + remaining assets).I think a buy out anytime soon is quite unlikely, but if it were to happen I would expect it to be NCM buying the whole of GGP and effectively cracking on with Havieron development whilst putting the rest of GGP into their exploration arm.I, like others, struggle to see a third party coming in as their ability to optimise their purchase would effectively be at the whim of NCM.",No Opinion,14.0
14 Dec '21,Tildo,RE: Take over,Good post.Option C example of 1.5Bn offer for 30% Hav. How as a shareholder can I extract value unless the board back the deal with a cash back special dividend? SD as CEO could only accept a cash deal if the money released the buisness to do its exploration or invest in other company growth assets otherwise he is simple hollowing out the business. But as a shareholder I donât see this working for me as you have sold the prize asset and the SP would drop substantially even with piles of cash in the bank. I just donât see this working for anyone. Has to be option A or nothing in my view. Itâs the only way everyone wins assuming of course the offer is good enough.,No Opinion,14.0

14 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: Take over,"As there has been a lot of discussion today regarding the possibility of a âtakeoverâ, I thought Iâd offer a few comments outlining what this might mean.Essentially there are four scenarios to consider:Scenario A - In this scenario NCM makes an offer for 100% of GGPâs shares - In many ways the simplest scenario, and perhaps the one most LSE posters have in mind - GGPâs board are required to notify shareholders if ââ¦a firm intention to make an offerâ¦â is received - the oft-repeated notion that an offer would have to be above the highest SP in the last 12 months is mistaken - 75% acceptance from all GGP shareholders would be required to proceed as a âscheme of arrangementâ - the remaining minority shareholders would be squeezed out Scenario B - In this scenario ANO (ie not NCM) makes an offer for 100% of GGPâs shares - In procedural terms this follows the same path as Scenario A - BUTâ¦ there are likely to be âchange of controlâ (or similar) provisions in the JV agreement - ANO would want to know that NCM would honour its JV commitments, and would include this as an offer condition - NCM might not want a new JV partner, and could therefore use its majority interest in the JV to frustrate ANO - As a result I think the âbidding-warâ scenario sometimes discussed on this board is unlikelyScenario C - In this scenario, NCM agrees with GGP a price for its remaining 30% interest in Havieron - The usual âclass testsâ would be applied to determine whether such a disposal would be a âsubstantial transactionâ - The class tests examine 5 measures: Gross Assets, Profits, Turnover, Consideration & Gross Capital - A substantial transaction is one which exceeds 10% in any of the class tests. It triggers a shareholder notification - A scenario C disposal IS likely to exceed the 10% in one or more of the class tests, so notification would be triggered - Butâ¦ only a disposal exceeding 75% in any of the class tests requires shareholder consent - Based on todayâs figures, a disposal at <Â£425m could be below the 75% level on all of the class tests Scenario D - In this scenario, ANO agrees with GGP a price for its remaining 30% interest in Havieron - The likely âchange of controlâ provisions outlined in Scenario B would apply here - these could (for example) give NCM a right of first refusal at the same priceâ¦ - â¦or provide other ways for NCM to frustrate the introduction of an unwanted new JV partner - As a result I think this is fraught with difficultiesAs always E&OE with constructive questions/corrections welcomed. FWIW, I think that NCM will want 100% of Havieron and that scenario C is the most likelyâ¦",No Opinion,14.0

14 Dec '21,MrEMC2,RE: AGM repeat?,My comments after the AGM (for what they are worth). 1.  Being at the AGM live was worthwhile as it was possible to ask questions particulary about the resolutions.  Told it was the live voting that passed the resolutions - the proxy votes come into play if there was doubt about the results of the live voting - I don't know how true that is.2. Alex B said that there was a protest vote for resolution 2 (his re-appointment) by nominee accounts against Non Executive Directors receiving share options rather than a large margin of votes against him personally.   He did not say whether that means the company would change renumeration process in future.3. Retail investors own most of the shares and it they that have had the most influence on the share price in 2021 - buying took it up to 38p in a thin market;  and selling by those who have made lots of profits incl GH (but not me I hasten to add) was a lot for the market to absorb  hence the drop in share price.4.  IIs only willing to buy at a low price - hence IIs still very low proportion of share holders.5. Anything over 30p is probably pie in the sky (unless we find another Havieron type discovery on our other tenements)6. Share price performance is perplexing given the excellent but it most likely down to actions of retail investors7. Comapny wants to foster a good relationship with NCM so we are not suddenly going off exploring on another continent!8.  On takeover : Company X would put a proposal to the Board ; Board would put a recommendation to shareholders - you get to vote on the Board's recommendation not the Company X bid.  Board has duty to shareholders in making a decision.  Given that at present retail investors are majority shareholders no certainly on how any vote would go.  9. Having some IIs on the shareholders register potentially means we move forward.Can't say I came away from the AGM elated but lets see what 2022 brings .  GLA MrEmc2,No Opinion,13.85

14 Dec '21,Shady69,"RE: ""Every hole we've drilled has hit mineralisation"".","Glad to see the takeover carp  put to bed now. As for the SP  I think some people on here need to reflect on the way they behave  because some of you  have more influence on this forum than you actually think u have especially  on new investors and people actually wanting to buy into GGP. If you really understand the fundamentals there's no need to argueâ¦ spout negativity and engage with the obvious derampers about the company and  focus more on having this forum for encouraging new investors, without ramping too, providing good solid info like Bamps does on a daily basis. I'll admit I give nothing I've made my own mind up I'm not angry I've bought in here and I'm 50% down almost but I know I'll be quids in come production and that's because of the facts out there from the horses mouth's There's enough info now and SD and Sandeep have laid bare it all and hopefully the next upgrade will reflect their honesty. My advice to any new comer is just research yourself get on Proactive Investors and listen to all the positive videos they've been providing over the last 12 months the rest is just noise. GGP help site too is also another great place to go.  The biggest majority is Private investors it's our company and this continuous poison on here is killing the SP not GGP.

As an ex-FD I believe he is very organised, very much a ducks in a row person, so his take is that he has and will take all the steps necessary (building the right team, getting more drills active, liaise with IIâs, have exemplary ESG etc.) and the SP will then rectify itself. He stated about popping champagne corks over what we have which could be taken as a trite comment if you look at todayâs SP - but I donât think he is, as I think he is focusing on the fundamentals.

If they had not found GGP and Hav - they would have spent a fortune decommissioning the Telfer mine. Now they are looking potentially at a further 30 years of profit from Hav/Telfer before they cross this bridge again. No wonder Sandeep smiles every time he mentions it. NC now been drilling with 8 rigs for 2 years - still open in multiple directions - and new targets within Hav blocks - Hav has the potential to truly be a block caving monster. But it's going to take a bit of time to find out resource size - could take years. So would NCM like the other 30% - of course they would. They would want to get it at the best price - but I doubt they would be part of any underhand activities - nowadays a company's reputation has huge value. Would they try and take out a junior explorer - and partner in other JV's with a very lowball unfair offer - I'd be surprised.

13 Dec '21,BiggL,RE: REDDIRTS PAYDAY,"A reasonable post from Matty, here are some metrics to considerThe drilling results have indeed been fantastic (though finding very deep lying gold) so letâs assume that Havieron eventually gets to 10m measured and indicated ozs, which NCM have paid $70m to get 70% ownership of, so that would see them owning 7m ozs which effectively cost them $10 per oz. Of course Sandeep loves it! NCM have total M&I resources of about 100m ozs (plus copper), and a market cap of A$18.95Bn, equaling US$13.56bn or US$135 per oz. They produce 2m ozs per annum in multiple jurisdictions, generating strong cash flows and pay a 3.2% dividend. The current GGP market cap is Â£571m, converting to $753m, so any newbie buying into GGP today will be effectively paying $753m for what will hopefully be 3m ozs of (M&I) gold, or $251 per oz, almost twice the valuation of NCM today.Yet GGP is still not producing, so you would expect the disparity to be the other way round and for GGP to be valued (on a per oz basis) at less than NCM.If you think that NCM might pay (say) $125m for 5% of Havieron, (500K ozs), that is $250 per oz. Logically the market response to that would be to shrink the NCM market cap. After all NCM would be paying $250 an oz for something that the market will then value at $135 per oz.That is why I think it unlikely that there will be a bonanza coming from the 5% option.",No Opinion,13.8

11 Dec '21,zoros,RE: SE crescent,"Canary - very well spotted, indeed! I picked up on that and thought - mmm, change to original plan slipped in there hoping no-one will notice!.  So here goes, regarding the decline progress:When news started filtering out that the decline was under construction a number of posters started guessing the monthly rates of progress...it included me unfortunately. All of us have added to the myth that this was going to be something earthshattering in speed resulting in the arrival at the motherlode (@ 350m deep) between Q1/22 and Q3/22.It started on 12th May 2021 and progress guesses ranged between 150 and 700m/m (the latter being the world record held by Byrnecast (our diggers)). I averaged it out @ 250m/m for the roadmap. This meant the arrival estimated around June 2022.Then the Byrnecast web site appeared and they were flagging up 154m/m.....Ouch!I spoke to GGP about this in June 2021 and how it would affect the completion of the decline. They came back and said this was the early stages rate/month estimate due to poor ground conditions/aquifer. They stated they would soon clear these layers and progress would increase significantly.  Since then as you know we have been getting snippets of the rate of progress on several occasions.  The latest indicates that thus far, 250m has actually been dug out over 7 months which works out @: 36m/m!!!  This equates to 7 years digging!  Arrival time:2029.In a way, when you heard SD say late 2023, to the uninitiated, it seems that there has been a major delay with the earthworks (based on our assumptions: mid to late 2022). But in reality what we are seeing here is that, yes, the initial delay is still causing problems, progress is slower than expected but it will increase if we are to meet this timeline SD mentioned (of late 2023). And ironically over the 30 month period aired by SD, guess what:  the rate of progress will be: 150m/m. Close to that figure advertised on Byrnecasts' web site.  Funny old thing.I have changed my roadmap to reflect this now and of course the knock on effect of everything else that would follow from the completion of the decline.[The other 'thing' that changed over the last 6 months, is that the original decline distance of 2600m has grown to 3000m due to ancilliary roads and passing places been added on]BestZ",No Opinion,14.1

He knows what Havieron is and he knows how fortunate Newcrest are to have a seemingly infinite supply of gold down the road from their dwindling supply .In my view the selling en masse will cease in the near future , simply because the big boys won't have anything left to sell .That's when the big rerate will occur .Together with forthcoming news I don't expect that to be too far away .Havieron alone supplies Greatland with a cast iron insurance policy .",No Opinion,14.1

You have a huge following on here and justifyingly so, I support that ethos...You are enthusiastic, you know your geology, you have a resonable grip of investments and I believe you too, do your own research.  You bring vibrancy and fresh air to this board (as do several others). When a.n.other comes on here and explains an issue which they know agreat deal about and quietly try to educate the rest of us about it....is that not the same as your remit? It may not 'tally' with your understanding of the situation but they have a greater understanding of that particular subject. Surely it counts for something? And if that something helps others 'clear the air' and give them clarity towards their research....power to their elbow.WRT shorting this stock - in my humble experience, there is shorting of this stock to some degree but a) it is miniscule and b) it happens to many many of the other thousands of stocks on the FTSE (3000+).  It has a purpose, which is why it isn't made illegal.  The post from Blue @ 0936 this morning sums it all up so eloquently for me and they come from someone who did it for a living.  Unfortunately for him it is like whispering into a hurricane after months (even years) of posts promoting the shorting fiasco that GGP has become (not).In direct answer to you asking why this and why that during market manouvres......I am at a loss to explain them, except to say this......what is going on with this share price is perfectly normal. Between where the journey started to where it is going to end, the SP will behave accordingly and in line with statistics going back decades. We started below a penny and we will end at serious levels, shorting and manipulation will be a distant memory except to say it caused unnecessary pain and angst to all those who hang off every word some posters print and who have done little or no research. Provided GGP doesn't get bought out (for another discussion, no doubt), those who have done due dilligence know in their hearts that this will come good and resonably soon...probably beyond their wildest dreams.All I ask is that the journey for everyone is one where it has been a pleasant one based on fact not fiction.

10 Dec '21,hydrogen,November CPI inflation 6.8%,"Inflation accelerated at its fastest pace since 1982 in November, the Labor Department said Friday, putting pressure on the economic recovery and raising the stakes for the Federal Reserve.The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 0.5% for the month and 4.9% from a year ago, which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid-1991.The Dow Jones estimate was for a 6.7% annual gain for headline CPI and 4.9% for core.With unemployment claims running at their lowest pace since 1969 and gross domestic product expected to show strong gains to end 2021 after a lackluster third quarter, inflation remains the biggest problem for the recovery.The Federal Reserve is watching the data closely ahead of its two-day meeting next week.Central bank officials have indicated that will begin slowing the help theyâre providing in an effort to tamp down inflation. Investors widely expect the Fed to double the tapering of its asset purchases to $30 billion a month, likely starting in January.

Will GGP be able to treble the existing indicated resource base from the current 1.9m ozs up to 5.7m ozs?Well let us say that they get to 6m measured and indicted ozs of AuEq @$280 valuing Havieron at $1.68bn?GGP is arguably worth 30% of this or $500m and 5% of Havieron is worth $84m, ballpark and rough estimates of courseBut wait a minute, the Dixie project is located right in the middle of an established mining region, skilled workforce available, 25kms from the nearest town, with a paved highway running alongside and good power connections. They envisage an initial open pit mine, with hugely impressive near-surface grades. So low-low capex unlike Havieron, where it will cost $2bn capex to get the block cave up and running as estimated by Hannam.Hmmâ¦ GGP will be very lucky to get $84m for 5% of Havieron by the looks of it, but anyway in the same ballpark that we worked out from the recent NCM acquisition of Pretium.Well that is my opinion anyhow",No Opinion,14.75

10 Dec '21,bluetigeruk,RE: Ladder short tactics,"Zoros - this is from Ortex own web site ...There have also been suggestions that stock lending data is less useful or less relevant due to synthetic activity surrounding a stock. You can create similar economic effects using derivatives or âsyntheticâ structures without ever owning the underlying security â options and futures being obvious examples. However, remember that almost all meaningful synthetic positions will be hedged by the underlying issuer. For example, if a significantly large put option is created, the issuer will likely hedge that position by borrowing and shorting the stock. ORTEX stock lending and short interest data therefore also include data related to synthetic positions....Here a counterparty creates a synthetic PUT - they issue the PUT and then hedge it by stock borrowing - ORTEX also says they take a short position - but thats not true - Ortex are selling you a product here.AIM MM dont run aggressive books - they are not allowed to - they have a Risk Manager who sets their limits and reviews regularly (BARINGS etc) most of their trades will be automated trades from you and me thinking our Â£20k trade is a monster - its not of course. An AIM MM will be given say Â£50k either way as a limit and if they go over that they have to square the book off - this means get the exposure back into the limits - thats why prices move - a MM sells Â£100k of shares to Zoros and needs to cover that quickly - MM will charge you a spread premium for a trade that size and then will quickly whizz around the other MM and Dealers to cover inside the price.  MM dont make their money by risking their capital - they make it by buying at one price and selling at another - they want to make 1p on 100,000 shares in 3 minutes - not Â£12p a share over the next 18 months.  They don't have the capital to do this. I worked as a dealer for a few years in the City so i understand how the market works between broker and MM. Anyway - AIM stocks are way too illiquid for most professionals - the door closes to almost nothing once the market gets fast - thats why Directors are advised to dribble out regular share sales every month on share options etc. Thanks Blue",No Opinion,14.25

10 Dec '21,TimberTrader,RE: Todays s.p is irrelevant.,"One of the most important, and extremely interesting  comments, made by Shaun Day yesterday, was in regards to Scallywag. Nearly 2 years ago I was joking about the step-outs that Newcrest were drilling to the NW of the main ore body. I asked Paddy at the time how far out these step-outs were in relation to the Havieron Newcrest farm in tenements, thinking how amazing it would be if the ore body could actually extend right through the 'border' in to our own 100% Scallywag tenements. Unfortunately the step-outs were still quite a distance from the tenement 'border'. Now, almost 2 years later, with further drilling and knowledge, it could now, possibly, be a reality. As I stated at the time, should this happen, and the mineralisation, extend much further towards, or indeed into, the 100% owned GGP tenements, beyond the Newcrest units, you can pretty much throw any current value estimates well out of the window, and start again!Another note is that, under the farm in agreement, Newcrest would have first option on the Scallywag tenement(s), should this happen, and that may well be a positive factor for them to continue to growth drill towards that area.

10 Dec '21,DjfWatty,Todays s.p is irrelevant.,"That is because all anyone has to do is look for another company with 30% or 25% of similar to Havieron in production with the add onâs GGP has in its jv with Newcrest, plus itâs 100% owned tenements. Then you will get an idea of how much Ggp will be worth when it goes into production in 2023. That will only increase as exploration drilling around Hav continues. Who knows there maybe even some gold before then extracted from what is being dug up. Tailings. After all something made c.b. Make the decision it was worth putting a deep drill hole into Hav. Think about it. As soon as the decline is finished and vent shaft done. Personally I canât see either company hanging around. Hav will go into production. Then drilling other tenements will ramp up exponentially. Those who canât see that, well, imv, shouldnât be investing as at this point itâs clear what route we are going down at this point in time. Maybe should be traders instead.In respect of the drilling Bamps is talking about. Take a look at the Mponeng mine. 4 Kimâs deep. I bet no one expected that when it commenced. Itâs still going and still profitable although gâs per ton much reduced. Why. Thatâs because deep vertical mines can be cheaper to mine. The deeper it goes and debt of producing the mine and getting the gold reduces. It can remain profitable. Have is now more than 1 mtr deep in places. If you want to have a go.

10 Dec '21,SpadesAspade,RE: Ladder short tactics,"Jiffy at least someone gets the idea. That is exactly what has been happening here these last few months. Itâs not been about making money by shorting in the way you would normally do it. Their gains will be made by buying up cheap shares from weak investors who capitulate under the tension of never seeing their money back. They will then go long, and make a great return on the shares they will have picked up cheaply. Most Piâs who are currently buying into GGP are not buying  millions of shares. They are buying thousands thatâs all, maybe a few hundred thousand at best. Why do you think the volume of shares traded is where it is. Most LTHâs myself included have not topped up. A few have but again not by many, a couple of hundred thousand at best. So when you see day after day sells going through for 50,000 100,000 200,000 at a time that is not Piâs selling. That is the shorters dropping bombs to destroy any rise in SP and more importantly, sentiment. They then buy them back in small 5,000 10,000 & 20,000 trades which seem to have no effect on the SP. Rinse & repeat over & over again. One thing with shorts is that it will end, it will turn 180 degrees and it will return to previous ATHâs. Donât get mugged off. Take note of what Bamps is telling you. Take note what Sandeep says and take note what Shaun says too. In the interview yesterday I had a little chuckle when SD came out with the word GINORMOUS, explaining just what the ore body has developed into.

10 Dec '21,JiffyBag,RE: Ladder short tactics,"SB,Several points to consider IMO.1. Re:  'The increasing stock on loan figure may just represent more chancers trying their hand at short selling; they'll get carried out when news compelling enough to attract meaningful capital from new investors arrives. It doesn't necessarily indicate a structured shorting programme over an extended time period as @Hydrogen proposes.'The official FCA reporting threshold for shorts reporting currently stands ot 0.1% , overall with the Ortex position my calcs show a current 0.85% shorting interest, yet as of now no official reporting via the FCA shorting register etc.. So why no reporting?Could that be because several parties as you have alluded to, all of whom are individually still below the 0.1% threshold will not trigger a report? Is this your thinking/ rationale,  In other words as you say... they'll get carried out when news compelling enough to attract meaningful capital from new investors arrives. ie Large institutional buys that will breach the dam and force the closure of shorts etc?2. I happen to think that because the ownership of GGP is by and large owned in the majority by a large PI %,  that there is a concerted effort by either an institution or other group of interested parties to try and  oust / reduce the PI's % share of GGP. Most particularly given the fantastic results as of late. The value of Havieron is growing day by day, as is our30%, hence the shorting action that we can now all agree upon is taking place because someone wants our shares as cheaply as can be ascetained, otherwise why do it?. Would you not consider therfore that this is a reasonable assumption?So in conclusion, the Laddering effect as a strategy in general for undermining PI's confidence is really what is behind all of this, ie We are going to steal your shares because no matter what the costs it will prove to be highly lucrative in the long term :O)Not having mine , GLA!",No Opinion,13.5

In practice this is likely to be cash, at a value equivalent to that of the shares borrowed. To borrow your 20m shares you'd need to commit Â£2.8m - the same amount as you'd need to buy them. Borrowing isn't a way to create a free pool of shares that you can play with, it doesn't work like that. You still need the capital to support the position AND you incur the borrowing cost. Not to mention the risk of the lender asking for the shares back (which typically they can at any time).If you are correct that buying in the afternoon can be achieved without moving the price up, then it would be better to build your pool of 20m shares first (even if this took a few afternoon sessions) and then enter into the series of morning sells into strength and subsequent afternoon buy-backs that you describe.Implementing the ""tactical sell trading"" idea from the long side - rather than from the short side as you propose - would be better because you would avoid the costs, complexity and risks associated with borrowing and shorting.",No Opinion,13.5

9 Dec '21,hydrogen,RE: Ladder short tactics,"Starbright - Isn't that obvious?:  you need enough stock in the first place to create (- well amplify) the initial downward pressure/momentum.  Then you can return any portion of that stock to T121, as required.. If the going gets tough, and the PIs start getting perky again,  due to a good RNS - you can borrow even more stock as they did this week to, to get the job done and sell into any rises, to continue to kill any positive sentiment... If they had to actually buy that initial 20m shares, to get going, there would be no downward momentum to sell into, they would  be selling to themselves.  The point is to create and amplify the downward momentum.   If you were in Telegram, Starbight, you could see who the sellers are on BBT... There are not many of them.",No Opinion,13.5

9 Dec '21,GoGreen1,RE: Ladder short tactics,"Hydro, I totally agree. Itâs manipulation for their own advantage and with anyone who is forced to sell funding it. The only defence we have as far as I know (as a private retail investor) is to hold strong and wait it out. Itâs annoying that the tactic can go on so long but it wonât last forever.

9 Dec '21,hydrogen,Ladder short tactics,"It's not quite shorting, in the conventional sense. It's tactical sell trading, using borrowed stock to bully the price lower, in a controlled systematic way and bull a large position for no cost.what they are doing is trading from a pool of borrowed T121 stock and bullying the price lower... Usually, selling starts 9.30 am and then buying back the vast majority of that stock but at lower price points towards the end of the session 2.30pm in a controlled fashion.   The system relies on grinding PIs down.  I think they are just a bunch of rich entitled spivs who will gain a say around 10m ggp shares for this hatchet job.   Start with 20m at 22p end up with 30m at 14p ...They use 100k to 500k size volume sells and the occasional big drop 1m ... but the problem is, they can't be left short open. more than 20m overnight. This is because over 0.5% net short position is reportable, so they have to publish their names and we can see their activities. They tend to close out to an overnight position of sub 20m net short to avoid reporting rules. This pressurises PIs, because they bully the price lower and lower each session. They also come on this board and spread fear doubt and uncertainty... . And then sell more into the drop, shaking pIs our and scooping up their sells and yours into a large seperate pot... slightly - say 3-5% - cheaper than they sold at. They have direct market access and can achieve much better prices on the buy and sell that we cannot.

Other alternative is to have add ons based on the increasing value of the ore bodies especially if they find new ones in 2023.

That is why I am saying that as the MRE grows the surely the SP has to follow. But as you know, the brokers will not take into consideration the growth that we have witnessed every 6-7 weeks throught 2021 until officially confirmed in an MRE update. Why that is, your guess is as good as mine. The way I see it is that the MM's & brokers have earn big bucks by riding our SP from 1.6p all the way upto 38.5p with commisions paid via huge numbers of transactions going through the books.They have equally done the same again this year by driving down the SP to were we are now.Hopefully next year they will do it all over again, by reversing this trend whereby raising our SP and making bucket loads of dosh again.

9 Dec '21,SpadesAspade,Something To Consider,"One thing that I have never seen mentioned here, is that 12 months ago we still officially owned 60% of the Havieron project. Now we only own 30%. That's 50% less ownership, and could that possibly be the main reason we have seen a 60% drop in share price. Just saying.As the upgraded MRE figures are released, then that 30% ownership should be valued accordingly. Double the Oz's, double the SP.I'm not saying we will double overnight, but there is no reason imo, as when the resourse estimate rises, then our SP should not follow suit.Philbrim, you say your major worry is that a lot of Pi's would vote for a buy out. The problem you would have there, is yes no doubt a lot would probably vote for it, but most of the LTH's here hold all the trump cards. Most of the holders who only bought into GGP within the last 12 months paid considerably more for their shares than anyone who bought pre 2020.Thus most LTH's probably hold on average 100 times more shares than post 2021 shareholders, and if i'm not mistaken it's still the amount of shares owned, and not how many Pi's choose to accept an offer.After another set of stellar results, I can see by todays post's there is an abundant sense of camaraderie and positivity between fellow holders, and long may it continue. Don't forget, GGP are that 1 in a 1000 company that are on it's way from exploration drilling to a full working mine, and all within 5 years. I have seen many discussions over the last few months regarding selling the 5% option that NCM are entitled to, but how can anybody put a value on that 5% when no one can say just how big Havieron is going to be. The problem I have with trying to put a value on it, is that whatever value is apportioned, you are then putting a value on the whole of our remaining 25% as well. I just cannot see our BOD's agreeing to any sort of sale of the 5% until we know a helluva lot more to what is actually contained within the Havieron licence.

Scallywag is a large, elongate magnetic anomaly with a strike length of more than 6km and is interpreted to be a structurally deformed sedimentary dome feature under approximately 50-100m of cover.I'll mention, yet again (sorry!), the crucial importance of the step out drill holes that Newcrest are currently taking, to the NW of Havieron.If the valuable, feasibly minerable mineralisation, extends further towards, or indeed, maybe even into, the 100% owned GGP tenements, beyond the Newcrest units, you can pretty much throw most of the recent low/high value estimates well out of the window, and start again! :-) """,No Opinion,13.05

9 Dec '21,hydrogen,Zipa is a hit... IMO,"Around 3 months ago I reported a new line of thinking about the genesis of Havieron. I believe eventually it will change the way geology books are written. Havieron is emerging as its own class of deposit - and way bigger than the analysts and the market currently appreciates.. Havieron is situated on an extremely deep, ancient crustal fault structure, thatâs has been re-activated and overprinted several times during Earth history. Almost uniquely, this led to mineral enrichment. What this suggests is Havieron is a much larger system than the market appreciates. It is likely to be more than a single breccia pipe. We now know the new Easter Breccia, is delivering outstanding world class drill results. SD confirmed the chemistry is categorically different to the main, sulphide pipe ovalâ¦ Ie 2 distinct, adjacent systems.. That is not disputed. SD reported it, and the un-expected presence of nickel.But now there's this: Follow the track north, from the explosive magazine : https://minview.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/#/?lon=122.6499&lat=-21.70633&z=16.6&bm=bm1&l=And what you will come to are the remnants of an old RC drill site. This was used by NCM last Xmas but the results were never disclosed... Why, I cannot say. But it was there - I am 100% Certain. Paddy saw it at the time but this new High rez image contains tell tale evidence, it in all its clarity. You can see the characteristic white scarring - RC drill tailings from the white Permian tillites, (as per the Portal excavation and roads). If you look at the Kraken drill sites - you see the same - a path leading to some white/grey scars on the landscape to compare: https://minview.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/#/?lon=122.5780&lat=-21.69138&z=17.9&bm=bm1&l=(NB: kraken Pads were Diamond core, requiring sumps, and ground levelling; hence a more defined pad construction). NOW This is the drill pad we saw on the ARV boundary... The pad's location cross references exactly with the activity PaddySAT observed over Xmas: https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1464169450257764368?s=20https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1458821037752258561/photo/1Now consider the proximity of these Northern pads, illustrated by this Artemis drone image: https://twitter.com/ArtemisResource/status/1463418348608368641/photo/1https://twitter.com/ArtemisResource/status/1451860419015020546/photo/1Again you can see a proximal or âcluster relationshipâ in relation to the explosives magazine. I count 4 Drill Pads clustered at Zipa/Hav North within 600- 800m diameter. It's so much closer than it looks on the satellite images .All within 2.56km of the main deposit - a cluster of breccia pipes shaping up to be potentially one of the largest gold discoveries for 40 years... hitting intervals 120m at 10g/t Au in completely new zones. 1 drill and meh! 2 drills and mmm? 3 drills, now this is interesting...

The SP is a reflection of market sentiment based on several factors - earnings and assets being amongst them but the average personal investor does not look to the these numerical factors (just can they make money in the short term based on others reactions to the stock) but as we have seen there is no direct correlation. Banks however base their credit decisions on professional valuations / JORC resources and future cashflow forecasts / strength of BoD / commodity forecasts / geopolitical considerations /environmental factors and personal reputational considerations in the case of a questionable industry (not a factor here).

The problem you would have there, is yes no doubt a lot would probably vote for it, but most of the LTH's here hold all the trump cards. Most of the holders who only bought into GGP within the last 12 months paid considerably more for their shares than anyone who bought pre 2020.Thus most LTH's hold probably on average 100 times more shares than post 2021 shareholders, and if i'm not mistaken it's still the amount of shares owned and not how many Pi's chose to accept an offer. One thing that I have never seen mentioned here is that 12 months ago, we still officially owned 60% of the Havieron project. Now we only own 30%. That's 50% less ownership, and could that possibly be the main reason we have seen a 60% drop in share price. Just saying.As the upgraded MRE figures are released, then that 30% ownership should be valued accordingly. Double the Oz's, double the SP.

8 Dec '21,hydrogen,Zipa is a hi...t IMO,"Around 3 months ago I reported a new line of thinking about the genesis of Havieron. I believe eventually it will change the way geology books are written.  Havieron is emerging as its own class of deposit - and way bigger than the analysts and the market currently appreciates.. Havieron is situated on an extremely deep, ancient crustal fault structure, thatâs has been re-activated and overprinted several times during Earth history.  Almost uniquely, this led to mineral enrichment. What this suggests is Havieron is a much larger system than the market appreciates.  It is likely to be more than a single breccia pipe.   We now know the new Easter Breccia, is delivering outstanding world class drill results. SD confirmed the chemistry is categorically different to the main, sulphide pipe ovalâ¦ Ie 2 distinct, adjacent systems.. That is not disputed.  SD reported it, and the un-expected presence of nickel.But now there's this: Follow the track north, from the explosive magazine : https://minview.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/#/?lon=122.6499&lat=-21.70633&z=16.6&bm=bm1&l=And what you will come to are the remnants of an old RC drill site. This was used by NCM last Xmas but the results were never disclosed... Why, I cannot say. But it was there - I am 100% Certain. Paddy saw it at the time but this new High rez image contains tell tale evidence, it in all its clarity. You can see the characteristic white scarring - RC drill tailings from the white Permian tillites, (as per the Portal excavation and roads). If you look at the Kraken drill sites - you see the same - a path leading to some white/grey scars on the landscape to compare: https://minview.geoscience.nsw.gov.au/#/?lon=122.5780&lat=-21.69138&z=17.9&bm=bm1&l=(NB: kraken Pads were Diamond core, requiring sumps, and ground levelling; hence a more defined pad construction). NOW This is the drill pad we saw on the ARV boundary... The pad's location cross references exactly with the activity PaddySAT observed over Xmas:  https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1464169450257764368?s=20https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1458821037752258561/photo/1Now consider the proximity of these Northern pads, illustrated by this Artemis drone image: https://twitter.com/ArtemisResource/status/1463418348608368641/photo/1https://twitter.com/ArtemisResource/status/1451860419015020546/photo/1Again you can see a proximal or âcluster relationshipâ in relation to the explosives magazine. I count 4 Drill Pads clustered at Zipa/Hav North within 600- 800m diameter.  It's so much closer than it looks on the satellite images .All within 2.56km of the main deposit - a cluster of breccia pipes shaping up to be potentially one of the largest gold discoveries for 40 years...  hitting intervals like 100m at 10g/t Au in completely new zones. 1 drill and meh! 2 drills and mmm?  3 drills, now this is interesting...

Their existing holding and their option on the 5% plus any new shares their associated investment vehicle is accumulating they will make a bid for the company that suits their wallet and shareholders. Unfortunately for us we wont get to see this evolve into the resource that we all know it will be and the associated value.

To compare the two minnows, like for like could prove difficult and at the very least take up the rest of the afternoon discussing it. So, if I may, I will highlight why I think that (pro rata) GGP is more highly priced than Solg:GGP has completed its PFS.  Solg hasn't. GGP is in a mining friendly jurisdiction. Solg isn't.GGP(or rather NCM) have a mining plan. Solg don't.GGP 'talks' to the shareholder. Solg rarely speak to their shareholders.GGP has a cohesive BoD. Solg doesn't.There is a timeline to production with GGP. The timeline for Solg is precarious and unresolved.On your last point (broker prices). The latest from BB shows 24p.  Between them (Canaccord/SiCapitol/Hannam) show between 33p and 66p long term from past broker notes.  The reason for the latest downturn by BB is solely because the SLOS costs have almost tripled. ALL of these quotes are/were based on between 10Moz and 12.5Moz.  Be not afraid of this devaluation by BB, they will ramp up accordingly as more MRE's appear.Solg are HUGE and growing as more of their regionals flag up resources. 10MtCu / 22MozAu / 100MozAg in one tenement alone.

8 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: S.p. Macro level.,"Thank you Zoros. I agree!The negative sentiments that dominate discourse on this âboard are artefacts of the anchoring bias created by the spike, and will only be undone by significant recycling of the shareholder base over time.Anchoring is the underlying cause for the endless posts about ââ¦ why so many still think the SP is currently underrated... horrible year for the SPâ¦  Market manipulation holding the SP backâ¦ Shorting causing the SP to stay lowâ¦â etcTo these you can add all the comments about how badly SD has done, about how the SP will âspring backâ when âthey let it goâ etc etc etc.Look through the words and you will see that ALL these expressions are framed by an implicit comparison with the transient spike high. Very little thought is given to the reality that GGP is a tiny company (17 employees?) valued at nearly Â£600m despite not being expected to produce any gold for several years.

8 Dec '21,Sycho,Walking on eggshells.,"Walking on eggshells, yes, that's what it's like to post on this forum these days. If you don't upset one mindset then you certainly upset the opposite mindset, no matter what your view or opinion.The time for civil and cordial views and opinions re GGP are long gone and all because of money, money the root of all evil and evil now resides on this forum.Greed, avarice, self indulgence and pleonexia, all the tools of the Devil. The thing is, we're all in the same boat and not one poster, whether for, against or just indifferent towards GGP sp, can make anything change.IMO the CEO has not helped this situation, but that's my view and I'm entitled to it, without fear of abuse, ridicule or name calling. Those that see no wrong from SD, then that's your view and you're entitled to it.Expectations went way too high, there are IMO things that don't sit well with me on a few issues, but I'll keep them to myself.Too many people have become emotionally attached to this stock and the CEO. 2020 sp action took over rational thinking and many struggle to deal with 2021 events, which has caused concern despair and anxiety.I suspect many are seriously over-exposed here based on last years euphoria, yet not one person will admit to that, as is human nature.I believe in this asset, though I still have my reservation about SD and as value continues to erode under his stewardship, so my confidence in him will continue to wane. That said he still has much to do to restore value and confidence, 12 months in situ is when to judge him firmly.He presides over one of the strongest assets and fundamentals on Aim, to use a football analogy on sp performance, it's like missing a penalty with no goalkeeper.We PI's are divided on the raise, some for and some against, whatever your belief, it's no reason to ridicule. Whatever the malicious malevolent underhand machinations by the unclean are doing behind our backs, we need to live with it because posting here won't stop it, angst, belligerent behavior and in fighting between members here won't stop it.I know that, they know that and your need to accept that or put your dough in the bank.That said, it will come right when certain catalysts kick in, of which there are many. These catalysts may take several more months or longer to come through.In general the PI forward thinking mentality to investing is short to medium term, the big unclean money thinking is the long game, if your finances allow you to play the long game then you will win, unfortunately, not all have the same financial time horizons, this is the catalyst that allows the darker side of people to emerge in their posts.Â This is still a long play, but a very big play.United we stand, divided we fall.GLA",No Opinion,13.9

8 Dec '21,zoros,RE: S.p. Macro level.,"I never cease to be surprised why so many still think the SP is currently underrated...Comments like ""horrible year for the SP"".Market manipulation holding the SP back.Shorting causing the SP to stay low. (It forms a part of every day life on the SE).In fact it frustrates the hell out of me if I am being honest. Why can't ""investors"" (and I say that with tongue in cheek) understand why the SP is what it is?Perhaps it is because many have lost so much that they think it's 'unfair',  or it has become personal and they are consumed with doubt about their investment strategy.I have been and am invested in more than one junior exploration company...been doing it for years, so what I see now is what I have come to expect.  I say again: There is 2MozAu indicated @ Hav currently. GGP owns 0.6Moz.  ALL of it is in the ground. The market has afforded a value of circa 15p..THE END.  Suck it up.[Solg has atleast 20MozAu and its SP has been around 20-30p for years - because its gold is IN THE GROUND still).When the MRE2 comes out next year, the brokers expect circa 10Moz of which 'possibly' (my words) approx 3.5Moz could be rated as indicated (in total).  They have afforded this increase in resource, the princely sum of: 24p.  Suck it up guys.NCM own 70% of everything. Remember that. The SP reflects this.The SP of a junior miner (or minnows as I call them) always lags behind the prize. There is a process to follow, a game to play and GGP are no different from any other minnow.All being equal, the SP will steadily climb especially at seismic moments  but it is where it is currently because THE GOLD IS STILL IN THE GROUND. When that circumstance changes....that is the time to watch the SP like a hawk.  Calm down, do some research, look at other minnows as they progress along their own paths and cut through the incessant ramping (just as you do with the doom mongers), to properly prepare yourselves for the final outcome.The halcyon days @ GGP are over. Making  3 or 4 digit (or even more) profits are gone forever.  If you weren't one of those during that period.......it ain't going to happen now.  Suck it up.  Everyone who is in now, will make a decent profit...one, definitely two years from now but do your own maths and try to understand why GGP is in this 15p channel for so long.The rest is down to patience and resilience. 2022 WILL be a good year for GGP...its time is coming.

GGP was massively overvalued at the start of '21 on the back of the mother-of-all-ramps coupled with a uniquely price-insensitive buyer in size. It's taken/taking (depending upon your point of view...) a long time for the bubble to deflate. In the process a lot of investors have seen their dreams punctured, and their pain is visible here daily. Well over 5bn shares have changed hands this year at a VWAP >21p, so many many hold parcels of shares that will need +50% from today's SP before they are above water.The first rule of Italian driving applies now though... https://youtu.be/fDaONrHK1f8",No Opinion,13.9

7 Dec '21,DjfWatty,S.p. Macro level.,"Iâve been researching as to why our s.p has had such a horrible year 21. There were a number of reasons such as a pull back in certain metals due to fears over covid. Disruption in logistics. I.e. getting the metal from a to b. The gold price following the price of bonds. Traders and funds leaverage against the price of gold. Interestingly the price of gold seemed to have followed covid. The only thing I could fathom as to why would be due to logistical problems. So Reading various articles I just concluded all the angst around why Ggp in particular has dropped so far is more to do with global issues right now which has effected the whole mining sector in particular but also the market as a whole. Future forecasts does talk about a recovery by 2023. With the arrival of the new variant omicron will not help. But it seems regular vaccination may resolve that obsticle. However the good news is the price of gold is cyclical. So what goes up got to come down and vis Versace. What goes down will recover. As long as it does for 2023 is what we should concern ourselves with. If that is the case recovery couldnât be timed better as, all being well, that is when Ggp will be producing and bringing in an income.",No Opinion,13.9

7 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: GDXJ,"Yes. See timings below, from a post I made a week or two ago.- The reference date is 30/11/21, so changes will be based upon constituent / aspirant MCaps at that date.- Changes will be announced on 10/12, and implemented on 17/12- As GDXJ (or technically the underlying index MVGDX) is cap-weighted, the principal impact(s) will be through âreconstitutionâ not ârebalancingâ (see below)- Rebalancing (the process through which index weights are set) effectively occurs daily in a cap-weighted index / ETF- Reconstitution is the diarised process through which names are added to or removed from the index / ETF- GGP is presently the 36th (of 100) largest index component so wonât be removed from the index- Reconstitutions only impact existing index weights when large new constituents are added (for example when TSLA joined SPX everything else had to give up a small % to make room). I canât see an obvious large addition this time around, please correct me if Iâm wrong!- The SP impact for GGP last December was unique as it was the addition of GGP to the index. Thatâs not happening again, soâ¦- Itâs highly unlikely that the forthcoming rebalancing/reconstitution process will have any impact upon the SP of GGP- I donât see any particular opportunities for the APâs to âinterfereâ with GGP price-action in the run-up to the rebalance date",No Opinion,13.9

A tale of incredible stress, heartache, patience, battles with your inner demons. Not to mention the battle with the Market demons. Only to triumph and see it through to the end, when you finally reached the end of that rainbow.Lets make no mistake about it, this is a colossal gold deposit, it is in effect, your underground iceberg scenario. And yes, we've only just started to comprehend the sheer magnitude of whats going on down there.Sandeep has said this, ""âIt is an incredible achievementthat, within two years of starting the Havieron drilling program, we have been able to deliver this significant projectmilestone and demonstrate financial returns that comfortably exceed our hurdle rate""So NCM have crammed about 6 years of work into 24 months, wow, thats a, ""Carlsberg don't do gold mining, but if they did"" statement.SB, ""We have recently delivered several new and exciting high grade intercepts which extend the high grade mineralisation beneath the initial Mineral Resourceestimate and highlights the potential for further resource growthâ.

6 Dec '21,BiggL,RE: NCM Buyout,"Consider what Sandeep Biswas might pay for 5% of Havieron by reference to his recent forays in the market, especially the recent acquisition of Pretium in British Columbia where he paid $2.8Bn for a company with measured, indicated and inferred resources of over 10m ozs grading over 10 g/t. Currently producing 348K ozs a year, and expecting over $300m ebitda this year.Now $2.8Bn works out at about $280 per oz for a long life mine, with further exploration potential and no monster capex imminent. In contrast Havieron has years to go to production and according to the scenario projected by Hannam, $2Billion capex will be required to get block cave mining set up.Currently Havieron has 4.4m ozs of AuEq grading 2.6 g/t. So let us be generous and say they might double that with all the impressive drilling results, and round it up again to 10m ozs, with years to go to full production. So with that very deep orebody, large capex required and years to go to before it generates any cash, let us say it is worth half of Pretium, so $140 per oz, making it $1.4bn in total. So 5% of this is arguably worth no more than $70m, donât forget that the buyer will have the dubious privilege of stumping up a big chunk of capex for its share of block cave mining.Perhaps best to take a range of estimates using different approaches and it will likely lie somewhere within that rangeAll in my opinion",No Opinion,14.05

I  hope it will fall into Q3/4 of CY 2022 personally because of the time it will take to prove up all these drills into meaningful resources. At the moment we have a lot of ounces that have yet to be converted to an inferred resource as a result of all the drilling. We currently have only 1.7moz ""inferred"" and 1.9m oz ""indicated"" but the cut off for drilling was February 2021 so nearly 10 months ago.In terms of ""Probable"" resource this amounts to only 1.6m oz at the moment. A great start but not enough to fully negotiate the 5% on.Companies value ""inferred"" resources quite a lot lower than ""measured and indicated"" resource and that in turn is lower than ""probable"" resource (we currently have only 1.6m oz in this category). We currently have absolutely nil on the ""proved"" resource category which would give us the highest value per ounce.https://greatlandgold.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GGP-Growth-Update-Final.pdf   (Slide 25 refers)So we will be in our strongest position to negotiate on the 5% once a lot of the drilling is converted to ""indicated"" and ""measured""; and then onward to ""proved"".Because of delays at the lab, which have been ongoing for most of the year, we are yet to see the emerging size of the giant that is Havieron. This in turn is likely to put a brake on any meaningful negotiations with Newcrest until Summer 2022    I would suggest though hopefully the upgraded MRE will be a good start to kick off very early preliminary negotiations from Feb through to June.We must not forget the copper as well as this will be a valuable resource for bargaining.In terms of the figures, I have seen some analysts coming up with a figure of some $200/oz for good quality ""measured"" gold resources in safe jurisdictions with low transport costs. ""Inferred"" resources on the other hand have been quoted at a quite a lot below this, so it is important to get our resources moved up the confidence chain as quickly as possible.

Again, I do feel Sandeep will be looking at this in terms of a longer ROI aspect along with a potential for an offer for the full 30%, so not so sure either is a given - although definitely can not be ruled out.

This is a precious jewel which we're fortunate enough to own and develop so I think, our risk of our share price risk is asymmetrical - if we're that - if we're unsuccessful at delivering that narrative to the market our bear case is that takeover comes and we get the 35-50-70% premium and we're taken out.Yeah I like to think the bull case is you know at least a theoretically unlimited upside in the share price as we fully unlock Havieron and look to leverage that platform for further financially disciplined growth - so that's the way I look at it you know, we are immature, we have a massive growth profile and every company in the sector wants a growth profile and that's all Greatland is right now.",No Opinion,14.2

5 Dec '21,Bamps21,RE: The week ahead,Drill 57W8No significant assays For this one I looked back at 57W7This drill found sulphides of 12.8m @ 5.3g/t from 962.7m to 975.5 and then crackle/ cemented breccia down to 1003.7mThe drill finished &1068mDrill 57W8 went down to 1157mI think the no assays are referring to the length between 1068 and 1157 testing the extremities of the ore body not achieved in W7,Strong Buy,14.15
5 Dec '21,Bamps21,RE: The week ahead,Drills 117W2 and W3No significant assaysThese 2 poked the drill bit into the top of the ore body and only went in 60m to the left of the Dyke.I think these 2 were a case of the historical drillers getting through the Permian cover and having to abandon that route twice.Remember the rerouted drill 117W6 gave us our best result of 120m @10 g/t and 0.66% and expanded that zone of sulphides and high grade breccia,Strong Buy,14.15
5 Dec '21,Bamps21,RE: The week ahead,Drill 147This drill was infilling just under the indicated resource and found 21.6m @ 4.3g/t & 0.15% cu in a crackle zone to the NE of the Dyke.Thatâs amazing to find that at that level which is close to what I believe to be a weak spot.Bodes well for the crackle grades,Strong Buy,14.15
5 Dec '21,Bamps21,RE: The week ahead,"Iâve been looking at the last drilling report.Surprisingly there were 5 drills that had no assays.Various reasons not a lot to worry about.Take a look at 147,147W1 & 147W2147 and W2 were fairly long drills testing the SE deeps from the NW getting to 1180m and 1250m vertical depths/ 760 and 830m ore depths.Whatâs happening with W1?On the plan it looks as though this drill enters the orebody to the right of the Dyke.It has a drill length of 900m while the other 2 entered the ore body at around 1,000m.On section 4 it shows these drills passing through the Dyke outside the orebody.What looks to have happened is this drill has found the Dyke sloping southeast and hit trouble getting through it.Dolerite is a very hard brittle rock and can damage or wear out diamond drill bits.With the other 2 going to the SE deeps, I donât think W1 was finding out where the Dyke was on the NE side, although it looks that way .More likely the Dyke damaged the drill bit and had to reroute around to drill W2",Strong Buy,14.15

5 Dec '21,caseyjones64,The week ahead,"So, NCM release latest drilling results on Wednesday night our time.  For the last 18 months, virtually every week when there have been drilling results the SP has gradually risen in anticipation of the results.  Some times the SP has then immediately fallen back on Thursday morning; sometimes it's risen initially and then fallen back as profit takers sell; some times (not recently) it's risen before and then risen some more the next day.So what do I foresee?  I don't know of course.  But I'd be surprised if we didn't see a rise in the coming days and in anticipation of that I've been buying over the past week.  And if there is any more weakness tomorrow morning I may buy some more.As others have suggested, there are lots of drilling assays to catch up on and no reason to believe they won't continue to impress; and just a chance of some other news.GLTAH.

5 Dec '21,Floater,RE: Some weekend thoughts,"Freddie,  good points for speculation, to comment on some:-Regarding the SP then many juniors are down this year and in my opinion it's just global economies, market forces and sentiment.  IMO then SD has done a good job but unfortunately up for judgement because of the SP but as with my first point above then it is tied in with those current parameters. I don't think it would be any different with GH and actually it would probably actually be regarded a great failure, by many.Concentrating on the 5% aspect:-MH01 - similar reply as me, but it's for the 12 blocks of within the E45/4701 tenement which includes Havieron, Zipa, Hav North and the other targets within that boundary - although the whole area is generally regarded as Havieron.If NCM were want to be sneaky and try and get the 12 blocks at a low price then why would they be drilling other targets in the area to try and prove mineralisation exists close to Havieron, and also why would Fraser MacCorquodale be saying there could be other Havierons close to the original :- âThis is all about (finding if there) are there more Havierons floating around Havieron,â  https://www.australianresourcesandinvestment.com.au/2021/08/03/newcrest-looking-to-find-more-havierons-in-the-paterson/Any other reasonable find within the 12 blocks would add value to the 5%. Also lets not forget that Havieron is still open at depth and at the sides, so the 5 % might not just be for what is known and may include an uplift for some assumptions of the open extent and the possibility of mineralisation at the other targets. NCM are experts are what they do, so they are not silly when it comes to exploration.Taking into account that NCM work in the ESG framework (and of course there is also the 3/2 committee at Havieron), then I'm quite sure NCM are not going to be dishonest or have GGP over with results, etc; they do work within the ESG framework.   Let's not forget Shaun has put together a formidable experienced team which is not just forward thinking to where he wants the company to go; it is also there to provide the expertise when working with NCM on the JVâs. Some people on here go on about NCM hiding drill results or playing it down at Hav â if unexperienced people on here can think that then do you not think the GGP board would also think that; and do people think they are not up to the task of assessing and analysing the results from NCM - really?  Also, GGP do have 2 members of the 5-person management committee at Hav and NCM might be the overall managers at Havieron but GGP are no mugs.So IMO the NCM and GGP will negotiate to a fair agreement for the 5% of the 12 blocks and it will not be a rushed decision, so should come after at least the MRE upgrade.I've got to go out now so others can speculate on your other points.",No Opinion,14.15

5 Dec '21,JoshSheps,RE: Some weekend thoughts,"I think we need to look at the broader picture, outside of Greatland Gold, the whole sector is down a fair bit so I donât think anything too untoward is going on personally. In regard to the 5%, newcrests growth strategy is to JV into discoveries, I think theyâll play with a straight bat, if they burn one junior on their finds, nobody will want to work with them so again; Iâm not too worried about newcrest. The 5% is calculated by an neutral independent party and then both parties will agree the figure. The logical thing would be to buy the 5% of what we know we have so we can fund everything going forwards and pay our loan off and then a 5% royalty for everything else beyond that. Has Shaun done a good job, hmm, juryâs out for me but only based on one thing, if youâd have asked it before the raise, Iâd have said heâs been relatable, communicated well  and put a great team together for going forwards but Iâm not at all regarding the raise. The raise itself is a great thing, Iâm just not happy with his comments saying weâre funded and then two weeks later dropping a raise and taking part at -10% the sp whilst weâve been bleeding all year. My only real concern here is someone taking us out, talks of bidding wars and huge premiums just donât happen as much as youâre lead to believe. 30-50% premium (Shauns words) is commonplace. 50% from here still leaves a lot of people underwater so I really want the Sp North to put us in a stronger position.",No Opinion,14.15

3 Dec '21,Redirons,RE: That's it! I have decided I am no longer sitting on my hands.,"Guys - you cannot access 25% of your fund for tax free cash without having to be subject to income tax on the other 75%. In Gimmeâs example you could draw Â£16,666.67 and be paid 25% tax free (Â£4,166.67). Then the remaining 75% (Â£12,500) is taxable but as the 0% tax band allows for the first Â£12,500 to be paid tax free, no tax would be deducted. However, in Gimmeâs example you cannot draw down Â£25k as tax free cash from the Â£100k fund and then look to draw down Â£12,500 p.a. for the next 6 years to avoid paying tax on the 75% (Â£75k) left in the fund. If you want tax free cash of a certain amount, you have to have the other 75% accountable to income tax. If you only need Â£16,666.67 per annum income, then happy days as you shouldnât pay tax on any of it. But if you wanted a decent up front amount of say Â£25k as tax free cash from your Â£100k fund then the remaining Â£75k becomes taxable at the point you ask for the Â£25k tax free cash. The pension side of it is quite complex but you can minimise the tax you pay through withdrawing smaller amounts - it just depends what you need, what you want and what size your fund grows to courtesy of the terrific performance of GGP.

Depends on your circumstance s and what your pot is invested in but might be better to draw a small sum â¦ pay the appropriate tax and let the rest grow â¦ you can the take 25%of the remaining fund tax free  at any future point.

3 Dec '21,Redirons,RE: That's it!

So if you wanted Â£25k cash, you would have to draw Â£100k to get your Â£25k tax free element but then Â£75k would be treated as taxable income and the tax bands would be worked through until some of it was taxed at the higher rate after exhausting the basic rate. Speedy could add to it tax free from his iSA as you say, but the main tax efficiencies of a pension are on entry (Â£100k invested in an ISA costs Â£100k but for a pension for a HRT only costs Â£60k due to 40% tax relief) but on exit the ISA is much more tax efficient with no taxes to pay whatsoever.

I stopped paying into it way back in 2005, when my provider kept asking me to put more in each year whilst at the same time telling me I was going to receive less and less. I changed tack and invested into the property market which was one of the best decisions I ever made. The frozen pension just sat there until I decided to convert it into a Sipp, were I then chucked the lot into here at 2.5p. One good thing that came from doing that, was being able to contact the HMRC and get them to increase my LTA from the Â£1.07M to Â£1.25M by using the 2017 Rule.Available to anyone who hasn't contributed anything into their pension fund since 2017. Another tax advantage of a pension is it being outside of inheritance tax, so if you are 6 feet under by the time you are 75, there will be no tax to pay on whatever you leave to your beneficiaries.

3 Dec '21,Redirons,RE: That's it!

Also if investing in a pension sponsored by an employer then the employers contribution is all bunce on top as well. Admittedly when drawing the pension it becomes taxable as income but until then remains in a tax free environment. Over time with an employer matching their employees contributions Â£ for Â£ you could see a Â£200k pension fund only costing the individual Â£60k (as the employer and HMRC paid all the rest!!!)

Assuming the MRE comes out in say....feb '22. And they 'assume' the SP will be around 25p as a result.One HAS to keep in mind this is only from the original MMRE volume (SE Crescent and N breccia (partial)) .

A reminder that NCM's staff are committed to working through the aussie summer at 45+ degrees of heat, to get our gold out of the ground: Others in the area have stopped work because they don't have the infrastructure @ Telfer (mini air-conditioned hotel!):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzhf1gU1mws(Bamps showed this to us about 9 months ago).The progress made via the decline will be around 250m+ currently. A reminder why it 'appears' to be less than expected.....I contacted GGP a while ago about this and they said that the initial layers were geologically challenging and also included managing an aquifer in the area. They expected rapid progress thereafter, when they were able to break through these layers.Passing areas along the decline are required and this means an additional (900m, thanks bamps) distance to dig. Mining capacity using declines (such as this one) and trucks tends to max out around 3mt/yr. This is the suggested plan for the SLOS if you recall (PFS:3Mt and 11yrs). If more resource needs to be extracted from the BUM, then my guess is that they will have to install a conveyer belt. Certainly if the figure (by Sandeep) of  12m+ tonnes/yr is required to feed the hungry Telfer (current max: 20Mt).

However,..as we are drilling more and more to get the other configurations of Havieron, our mining teams are thinking about what other options there might be for mining outside of the existing resource.I mean, there's no question that over time Havieron will probably need more than just one mining method. You can look at the Crescent Zone...that's where the initial resource is, and we'll be focusing on more selective mining methods there...that may go a lot deeper than we think, outside of our resource, which would be great news if it does, because that means that all the capital that we're installing now, we'd be applying it over a bigger resource, should that be proved up..Look at the other areas, which are yet to fully drilled out, you'll see that there are different shapes and also different grade profiles, which, if they prove to be contiguous, open up to some other more bulk type mining methods. So it's very much work in progress. It's really exciting.So we've kind of, but the focus is get those high grade tonnes from the crescent zone into Telfer, as soon as we possibly can, while we're working on what the entire deposit looks like.

3 Dec '21,StarBright,RE: gold,"The price of GDXJ (specifically the UCITS version that is likely the fund held by UK-based PI's) has fallen in recent sessions. As posters have pointed out, it appears to have fallen by more than might be expected by someone ""eyeballing"" price movements in the underlying holdings. Why is this?There are two ""less than obvious"" factors at work here:1.  GDXJ is unhedged, so non-USD-centric holders are exposed to FX movements. For GBP-centric investors in GDXJ, the recent strengthening of the USD has acted as a -ve drag on GBP performance.2. As we've seen a move toward ""risk off"", the GDXJ fund(s) have been sold by holders - depressing their price such that they have (at times) traded at a discount to their NAV. This means that a share in the fund trades for less than the value of the fund holdings.I hope this explains what you've seen @Luckytrader321.For anyone wanting to delve deeper... When an ETF trades below its NAV, the ""Authorised Participants"" (AP's) can exchange ETF shares bought in the market for index-shaped baskets of shares from the ETF sponsors. In very simple terms - if GDXJ falls by 5% and its underlying holdings have only fallen by 2%, an AP can buy $95k of GDXJ in the market and exchange it for a basket of shares worth $98k thus realising a $3k profit. In the process of buying the GDXJ shares they will - of course - drive the price upwards, closing the discount to NAV.",No Opinion,14.6

3 Dec '21,PaddyGall,RE: Ggp tweet,I've noticed in the recent Havieron Stage 2 document that was posted for public comment contained an image that showed the position of the decline had moved further South than the position in the original mining proposal. I'm guessing this was necessitated by the additional drilling that was done between the original proposal and the actual start of the decline showing that the SE crescent area was ever expanding to the S / SE and the spiral section of the decline needed to be sited further away for stability reasons (only guessing here though)What I did realise last night was the position of the foundations for the raise bore machine would be affected also and it lead me to look back at the satellite images over the past month or so as GGP stated in the last update that preparations for the vent raise would begin in this quarter.https://twitter.com/paddygall1/status/1466666423795654659?s=20A quick measure from the box-cut to the area where the concrete pad seems to be installed gives a distance of around 600-650m.

SGDJ was reorganized from ALPS ETF Trust into Sprott ETF Trust on or about 7/19/19. SGDJ is a continuation of the prior Fund and, therefore, the performance information shown includes the prior Fund's performance.The S&P 500 Index is a stock market index that tracks the stocks of 500 large-cap U.S. companies; it is included as a broader U.S. equities markets reference.",No Opinion,15.0

A change in interest rates will only be factored in when issuing new Gilts/bonds in the future, so your nightmare scenario is a little out of kilter - yes costs will increase, but only for new borrowing.

The question is: Why are Central banks buying gold like the clappers and the price falling ..? One minute gold is shooting up. The next J Powell re-nominated and it's crashing down. Why would gold be deeply attractive one day, and 'sell sell sell' the next? To make it an unedifying asset class by chance? On Tuesday night, Powell finally admitted inflation is here to stay longer.... ""I have the tools to fight inflation"" but he doesn't and he won't specify what the tools are. It's just another lie. Like application of the word 'transitory' to inflation in the first place.... Yes now he acknowledges ""it's time to retire the word transitory""... It's just becoming more and more obvious he's totally boxed in ... He cannot raise interest rates - from 0.1% whoopedoo!! - to even 2.5% as that would bankrupt the US.No nation has ever been able to repay debt to GDP proportions as huge as governments are currently running today. US interest payments on its $28 trillion national debt were estimated at $413 billion. That debt is being serviced at historically low interest rates. If the government increases interest rates it also suffers higher interest payments. UK in a similar position with debt levels at Â£2.2 trillion and annual interest for 2021 estimated to be in excess of Â£30 billion. If interest rates went to 2.5% the UK interest payment would be Â£55bn.... Any significant rise in interest rates could see a major default. But obviously that cannot happen, well it could, but it would wipe out almost everything.... But they could raise the gold price one weekend, via press release, at 11pm on Sunday night. To do this all they have to do is announce the FED are now buying gold at $5000/oz or $10000/oz or whatever they chose (after this inflation hit has been allowed to reduce debts by say 20%).Like Michael James Burry; you're insanely wrong on this, until you're so right, that you become subject of Hollywood movies.

Let's face it â¦ 1st point Berenberg are somewhat 'all over the place' with their price analysis.   I think the market âsuspectsâ 10 moz as a conservative estimateâ¦ Ie a fraction of what they will eventually find at Havieron.  We landed over 4moz in the first MRE.  There will be 4-5 of these, MREs over time, as they upgrade.Think about those ânew' pipes (as per Callumâs screensaver etc) to the northâ¦ Think about the 4 NCM pads 2.5km to the north and the extra time spent with rigs on each pad, which is now considerable ( in this new zone ) when they could be utilising these resources to drill the main Havieorn pipe and the eastern breccia â¦ This speak volumes  IMO.  Why deploy valuable resources away from your main target?Shaun has persuaded 6 funds to come in at 14.5p. Is thus becuase they think itâs 'over pricedâ at 14.5p and will not make any money â¦â¦.. or because they understand the reality is that potentially 15 moz  is a low conservative base case scenario?As you know I think 20-30moz is much more realistic.  But this takes time to delineate.   Albeit maybe only a 2-4 years in total and we're about 2 years in .Add in a couple of new pipes, around the deposit, and we start to get to some really big numbersâ¦  It's not going to move like it did last year,  unless the gold price blows up, especially with the IMO illegal shorting thatâs currently being used to by the SPIVs to squeeze out uncertain PIs. Look at Telfer 34 moz, I think.  Havieron will eventually be similar. Iâm still here because 1) I know for certain it's getting built out and fast.  And 2) because I know they are going to to discover a lot more gold.  The analysts at Berenberg in this regard, are useless. They can only report what's published and why they think form the drilling.  They cannot speculate about the areas around Havieron.

1 Dec '21,strudel,RE: MRE 2 sweepstake?,"I may be wrong but I think there was a line about what was going to be focused on next for infill drilling when the MRE was first published. We have the very pleasant issue of still being open in multiple directions and depth despite months of multiple drills working 24 x7. I believe they were going to try and get the correct density of infill drilling for another bit of the higher grade crescent really can't recall if it was the eastern or northern.The JORC stipulates a maximum spacing I'm sure so ironically our next MRE update may be relatively disappointing. But this, for the LTH-ers should not be an issue. If you consider that every time they send a rig to go off and do some far flung exploration hole they were probably expecting it to find nothing, so it would've then be redirected to get back into HAV central and continue on with infill drilling in and around the crescent. The fact that they keep finding gold in far off places means of the eight drills they have they probably have more than they expected still doing exploration and relatively fewer than expected focusing on infill drilling at this point in time.Also in the back of their minds must be the thought that they are constructing an exploration decline - they were wanting to use it to do much of the infill drilling without having the time and cost of drilling through 400m of cover repeatedly. I can see this MRE being a small uplift and then a rapid cascade of increases in MRE when infill drilling is more efficient from the top of the ore body..... Circa end of 2022 start of 2023 I think.

My working assumption is that 3Mtpa is the targeted rate, even if 2Mtpa was used for the PFS. YMMV of course...""The Stage 1 Study assessed mining production methods including SLOS with mining rates of 2Mtpa to 3Mtpa and caving options up to 6Mtpa. Surface infrastructure studies were focused on the transportation of ore back to the Telfer processing plant with a range of options considered in early-stage evaluations including conveyor, rail, pipeline and truck haulage, with the latter adopted for the Ore Reserve case. Processing studies evaluated a modified Telfer process plant to accommodate the Havieron ore.The initial Ore Reserve case is based on a ~2Mtpa production rate from SLOS mining method limited to the Indicated Mineral Resources within the South East Crescent Zone. The Stage 1 Study demonstrates the potential to expand the Project and increase the mining rate to 3Mtpa or more based on the upgrading of the current Inferred Mineral Resources and additional potential Mineral Resource growth from immediately below the South East Crescent Zone as seen in recent drill results (refer to Section titled Potential Exploration Growth for a summary of drill results).""",No Opinion,15.05

It all depends in these areas whether they have completed enough infill drilling to include in the next MRE.The Eastern breccia will definitely not be in the next MRE only 5 drills so far not enough.Thereâs 37m tons of maiden MRE not in the PFS most of these should be included in the next MRE but the mining plan may exclude some of these. Most of these are surrounding the sulphides only a small proportion are in the Northern breccia.There should be a big increase in the resource estimate within the Northern breccia between 4500 and 4200 and maybe lower.The sulphide zone below 4200 has high grades but the actual volumes of it arenât that great but theyâve been hitting this zone with infill drilling and should be included.

I canât see an obvious large addition this time around, please correct me if Iâm wrong! - The SP impact for GGP last December was unique as it was the addition of GGP to the index. Thatâs not happening again, soâ¦ - Itâs highly unlikely that the forthcoming rebalancing/reconstitution process will have any impact upon the SP of GGP - I donât see any particular opportunities for the APâs to âinterfereâ with GGP price-action in the run-up to the rebalance dateQuestions/comments welcomedâ¦",No Opinion,14.5

What I recall most memorably:Rick likes shorters and likes nothing more than knowing they're betting against him on a company he likes.You don't have to be an investing genius to do well.  You just have to be smarter than thousands of others.  Just turning up is a great start.  95% of investors don't even turn up.   They're in the 'Got a hunch, bet a bunch' group and in 40+ years, Rick's never seen those guys win.Be prepared to spend an hour a month (per stock in your portfolio) on research.   Again,  most people don't have the time or inclination to do that. Seeing a smug, calm expression on the faces of company staff is highly valuable and has worked for Rick.Not all positive drill holes are reported when expected   Some can be withheld or temporarily hidden.Having a beer with company staff, the drillers etc. has paid dividends.  Rick has spent a small fortune buying beers over the years. A great asset with poor promotion is way better than a poor asset that has great promotion.   Promotion can be fixed or improved,  a poor asset cannot. Rick offered (at the end of the video) to give his opinion / summary on mining stocks if listeners would submit them via his site.

30 Nov '21,Sammylamb,RE: Reason for sp spike?,Iâm pretty sure that JiffyBagâs thoughts re the shorters are right if the sudden lack of green boxes showing up from my filtered FUD posters is anything to go by. Theyâve moved on because there wasnât enough meat left on the bone here. Iâm guessing that they were meeting more and more resistance and decided to throw in the towel. There was probably going to be a gradual move up anyway with all the expected news.As an aside. People are now saying that it was way overbought here on the run up to Scally results. We were hoodwinked by rampers etc. My reason for going so overweight then was simply an eyes open straight forward gamble. I figured (and still do) that the upside would have been fantastic if Callum had indeed got the magic formula to keep finding massive deposits with the amazing precision heâd demonstrated at Havieron.,No Opinion,15.9

30 Nov '21,JiffyBag,RE: Reason for sp spike?,"Could be any number of reasons:1. Shorts have reduced to 27m from circa 42m, but bear in mind that Utilisation rate is 44%, ie potential amount of shares to be accessed for shorting purposes according to Ortex.com is equal to 27m divided by 0.44 = 61m sharespotentially  available for shorting. See Max's comment tonight, ie another circa 34m held on account.2. Link https://www.ortex.com/stocks/49473. Other reasons IMHO, institutions are now starting to buy in, which begs the question is it an institution doing the shorting?Anyway, just my thoughts, what really matters is to look at the long not short term, this time next year Rodney and we will all be millionaires :O)",No Opinion,15.9
